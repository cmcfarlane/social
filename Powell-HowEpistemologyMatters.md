88:  "If theory provides intellectual frameworks for establishing and evaluating factual claims and relating them to one another, epistemology provides frameworks for constructing, evaluating, and organizing theoretical claims."

88:  Sociology tends to distinguish between two epistemological poles: reductionism/holism. But, it is possible to organize "epistemological claims into a broad spectrum differentiable into at least five distinct categories or 'epistemic strategies.'" These strategies differ through "a qualitatively distinct conceptualization of social structure by attributing different degrees of *emergence* to collective social phenomena."

89:  "In strong *methodological individualism*, social structures have no explanatory weight or distinct properties of their own; they function as mere heuristics which must reduce entirely to explanations in terms of individual action. In epistemologically *constructionist* or *compositionist* theories, social structures appear as distinct phenomena with properties irreducible to individual action, which thereby account for external or objective constraint on action. Theorizing the further emergent dynamics generated by the interaction of social structures leads beyond compositionism to *heterarchy*, or 'tangled-systems theories'. Social order derives from the complex interaction of multiple systems, each driven by its own logic, and none of which can successfully constitute itself as a totality that embraces all the others. Totalization emerges in epistemologically *hierarchical* theories. Although multiple systemic logics may still apply in hierarchical theories, one of these systems determines all the others, at least 'in the last instance'. However, the totalizing system does not produce an organic unity of society; the logic of the system contradicts itself, generating irreconcilable antagonisms within the social order. In contrast to this, *holist* theories conceptualize social conflicts or contradictions as pathological exceptions to the strong integrative tendency of the social system."

90:  "Each epistemic strategy enables different kinds of theoretical claims and, as a consequence, generates different frameworks of expectation regarding the constraints and opportunities faced by sociology in general and public sociology in particular."

90:  heterarchy "allows an analysis of both performative and social contradictions. In radical, dialectical heterarchical theories, sociologists are faced with the challenge and opportunity of developing a science that is not premised on consensus but that can still transform the world through praxis."

91:  "If one theorizes rationality in individualist terms, then the main challenge facing public sociologists is that of legitimating their own activities to their publics, to the wider society that includes the dominant groups that public sociology aims to challenge, to their own colleague, and to themselves." Thus, sociologist build legitimacy by serving the interests of their publics in one of two ways: providing tools to control/manipulate social forces or by being politically expedient.

92:  "Pursuing this insight [constructionism/strong programme] has provoked intense controversy, in the form of the so-called 'science wars', as sociologists of knowledge (among others) have de-reified science and delegitimized its foundational myths of objective universality and transcendence of social contingency. This position gives rise to a *performative contradiction*. Constructionist accounts of science apply equally to sociology, including the sociology of scientific knowledge itself."

94:  "In a hierarchical view of rationality, truth is just as socially constructed as it is in compositionism. But instead of those constructions spinning off into a limitless plurality of differing local narratives, they resolve into a single bifurcated structure."

95:  "When perceived through the terms of a holist conception of rationality, Burawoy's subdivision of sociology into four types and his call for more public sociology appear either as the symptom of a pathological state of society, or as themselves pathological."

98:  "In dialectical heterarchy, differences appear dual, interconnected, overlapping, riven with contradictions, endlessly dynamic, inseparable but also unresolvable within the existing social order."
