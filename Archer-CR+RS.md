200:  "First, both are strongly committed to emergence and to the importance of emergent properties and powers in explanatory accounts of the social order. Second, under their own descriptions, both endorse the 'three pillars' of realism: a stratified social ontology, epistemological relativity, and judgemental rationality. Third, they conjointly deny Anthony Giddens's view that 'social relationships â€¦ [are] abstractions from our repetitive or routinized behaviour' based on rule-following, which as priority and indispensability for our relations."

200:  "centrality of 'social relations' because all emergent properties are relational."

202:  "it is concerned exclusively with *rel-azione*, that is, reciprocal interaction (rather than with *rapporto*, such as the statistical relations established between independent variables at the empirical level). The direct and crucial implication is that *social relations can never be reduced to interpersonal relations*. The latter are non-emergent because they can be 'personalized', that is, downwardly reduced to the influences of A upon B and vice versa. Instead, social relations are both the 'mediation' of prior structural and cultural conditioning and have emergent powers of causal consequence in their own right and of their own kind."

204-5:  "relational sociology provides an account of *social integration* as intrinsic to social reality."

205:  "Substantively, social science has become so engrossed by market exchange relations and political command relations that social relations have been squeezed out."
