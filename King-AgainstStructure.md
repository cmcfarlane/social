200:  Interesting that Archer bases her account of social ontology on Bhaskar who, in turn, claims his account of social ontology is compatible with Giddens's structuration theory while Archer, in effect, argues that Giddens's structuration theory is horrible.

200:  "the notion of an objective social structure becomes unsustainable" once the "interpretive tradition" is more "deeply" understood; thus, Archer/Bhaskar must be rejected.

200:  "echoes Randall Collins' reduction of macro sociology to its microfoundations and this article is, in effect, an attempt to apply Collins' arguments about micro-sociology to Archer's social theory."

202:  "Archer wants to preserve both structure and agency in order to remain true to what she calls the 'Janus-faced' nature of society with which she believes (wrongly, as I intend to show here) few can disagree."

203:  Notes that Archer must mean symbolic interactionism, ethnomethodology, and dramaturgy to mean "Individualists" even though she never cites one of them nor quotes a single line of their's.

205:  Per interpretivism, argues "the past is the meaningfully produced social relations between (now dead) individuals which have an impact on the present through the actions and interpretations of living individuals." In order to defeat Archer's arguments, interpretivism must demonstrate "social structure has none of these properties [viz., autonomy, pre-existence, casual efficacy] and is reducible to individuals---to other people---in all cases"

> This seems highly dubious. 

206:  But, argues that the first two (autonomy, pre-existence) are reducible to one another in that "If something is temporally pre-existent it must necessarily also be autonomous for it cannot pre-exist something upon which it is dependent."

206:  "Archer has fully recognized the metaphysical dangers inherent in claiming that society cannot be understood simply in terms of the interaction of individuals but believes that there are certain objective features of society which are, nevertheless, beyond any individual's knowledge."

207:  "Emergence allows the social theorists to tread that fine line between recognising that certain aspects of society are not reducible to the individual even though these aspects of society are still rooted in individual practice."

207:  "I want to demonstrate that in every case, appeals to emergentism can be reduced to the practices of other people, located at other places and times, and that, therefore, the morphogenetic approach cannot defend itself from collapsing back into an interpretive ontology."

208:  "In Archer's writing there are three main types of emergent property; the structural, the cultural and the agential." In terms of structural emergent properties, there seem to be three: numerical, relational, bureaucratic.

211:  "Archer's own model presupposes an interpretivist ontology which insists that social conditions are only other people."

211:  "Relational emergent properties refer to social phenomena in which individuals through interacting in new ways produce a novel social context which now confronts them and is independent of any one of them."
