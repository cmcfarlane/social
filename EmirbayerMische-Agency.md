963:  Elaborations of the concept of agency have been overly one-sided and, thus, misleading:

1. practice/habit(us)/routine (Bourdieu/Giddens, but also ethnomethodology, new institutionalism, and others)
2. goal-seeking/purposivity (rational choice, phenomenology)
3. deliberation/judgment (feminist, publicity-communicative)

963:  "While routine, purpose, and judgment all constitute important dimensions of agency, none by itself captures its full complexity."

963:  "our central contribution is to begin to reconceptualize human agency as a temporally embedded process of social engagement, informed by the past (in its habitual aspect), but also oriented toward the future (as a capacity to contextualize past habits and future projects within the contingencies of the moment). […] analytically situated within the flow of time. […] structural contexts of action are themselves temporal as well as relational fields"

967:  "[Alexander] is the first major theorist to systematically disaggregate the concept of agency itself, probing into its inner structure and delineating categories of agentic processes. In *Action and Its Environments*, Alexander (1988) proposes that action be conceived in terms of two basic dimensions, which he calls *interpretation* (further subdivide into *typification* and *invention*) and *strategization*. He intends by these analytical categories to synthesize, as did Parsons before him, the normative and utilitarian perspectives by presenting them as complementary but analytically distinguishable dimensions of human action."

967-8:  pragmatists (Dewey, Mead) and phenomenologists (Schutz) "insist that action not be perceived as the pursuit of preestablished ends, abstracted from concrete situations, but rather that ends and means develop coterminously within contexts that are themselves ever changing and thus always subject to reevaluation and reconstruction on the part of the reflective intelligence."

968:  From Mead, "Two insights in this [*The Philosophy of the Present*] are critical for our efforts: the concept of time as constituted through *emergent events*, which require a continual refocusing of past and future, and the concept of human consciousness as constituted through *sociality*, the capacity to be both *temporally* and *relationally* in a variety of systems at once."

969:  Mead's "three levels of consciousness, distinguished in terms of the increasing capacity of actors to actively constitute their environments through selective control over their own responses: (1) the level of 'contact experience,' characterized by immediacy of response to sense and feeling, (2) that of 'distance experience,' characterized by the capacity to use ideation and imagery in remembrance and anticipation, and finally, (3) the culmination of sociality in communicative interaction, in which social meanings and values develop out of the capacity to take on the perspectives of (concrete and generalized) others."

970:  Definition of human agency: "*the temporally constructed engagement by actors of different structural environments---the temporal-relational contexts of action---which, through the interplay of habit, imagination, and judgment, both reproduces and transforms those structures in interactive response to the problems posed by changing historical situations*."

970n5:  The unelaborated counterpart to this are "action's structural contexts." "*cultural context* encompasses those symbolic patterns, structures, and formations (e.g., cultural discourses, narratives, and idioms) that constrain and enable action by structuring actors' normative commitments and their understandings of their world and the possibilities within it. The *social-structural context* encompasses those network patterns of social ties that comprise interpersonal, interorganizational, or transnational settings of action. Finally, the *social-psychological context* encompasses those psychical structures that constrain and enable action by channeling actors' flows and investments of emotional energy, including long-lasting durable structures of attachment and emotional solidarity."

970:  Constitutive elements of human agency: iteration (oriented to past), projectivity (oriented to future), and practical evaluation (oriented to present).

971:  "*The iterational element* […] refers to *the selective reactivation by actors of past patterns of thought and action, as routinely incorporated in practical activity, thereby giving stability and order to social universes and helping to sustain identities, interactions, and institutions over time*."

971:  "*The projective element* […] encompasses *the imaginative generation by actors of possible future trajectories of action, in which received structures of thought and action may be creatively reconfigured in relation to actors' hopes, fears, and desires for the future*."

971:  "*The practical-evaluative* […] entails *the capacity of actors to make practical and normative judgments among alternative possible trajectories of action, in response to the emerging demands, dilemmas, and ambiguities of presently evolving situations*."

972:  An analytical rather than a real distinction. All three can be or likely are present in any given empirical instance, although it is likely that one is more predominant than the other two at any given empirical instance. Similarly, any given actor might be implicated in multiple contexts at once such that any given empirical instance resonates in multiple, overlapping, reinforcing and/or contradictory ways.

975:  "the past, through habit and repetition, becomes a stabilizing influence that shapes the flow of effort and allows us to sustain identities, meanings, and interactions over time."

975:  "*schematization* of social experience" […] "manifested in actors' abilities to recall, to select, and to appropriately apply the more or less tacit and taken-for-granted schemas of action that they have developed through past interactions." […] "The agentic dimension lies in *how actors selectively recognize, locate, and implement* such schemas in their ongoing and situated transactions."

978-9:  "how agency works to reproduce past patterns of action."

979:  We can subdivide iteration into three different processes: selective attention, recognition of types and categorical location. In relation to the two analytical parts of agency (viz., projection and practice), the future emerges through "*expectation*, the memory-sustained anticipation that past patterns of experience will repeat themselves in successive interactions, allowing relationships to be sustained or reproduced over time" while the present emerges "through *maneuver*, the improvisational orientation toward habitual practices, largely tacit and unreflective, which takes place in ongoing dialogue with situational contingencies."

983-4:  "human actors do not merely repeat past routines; they are also the inventors of new possibilities for thought and action." 

984:  "focus upon how agentic processes give shape and direction to *future* possibilities." "projectivity is neither radically voluntarist nor narrowly instrumentalist; the formation of projects is always an interactive, culturally embedded process by which social actors negotiate their paths toward the future, receiving their driving impetus from the conflicts and challenges of social life."

984:  "The locus of agency here lies in the *hypothesization* of experience, as actors attempt to reconfigure received schemas by generating alternative possible responses to the problematic situations they confront in their lives."

984:  "Projectivity is thus located in a critical mediating juncture between the iterational and practical-evaluative aspects of agency."

985:  "We wish to stress from the outset that projectivity does not always generate morally superior or desirable engagements with problematic situations."

988:  Three components to projection: narrative construction, symbolic recomposition, and hypothetical resolution. In relation to iteration and practice, we have identification (towards past) and experimentation (toward present).

994:  "The primary locus of agency in its practical-evaluative dimension lies in the *contextualization* of social experience. Again, we echo the pragmatists in stressing the communicative transactional dimension of such processes; through deliberation with others (or sometimes, self-reflexively, with themselves) about the pragmatic and normative exigencies of lived situations, actor gain in the capacity to make considered decisions that may challenge received patterns of action. This communicative process is what distinguishes the 'strong' situational moment of deliberative decision making from the 'weak' situatedness of what we call, in the interactional dimension, tacit maneuver. By increasing their capacity for practical evaluation, actors strengthen their ability to exercise agency in a *mediating* fashion, enabling them (at least potentially) to pursue their projects in ways that may challenge and transform the situational contexts of action themselves (although, given the contingency and uncertainty of interactions, the consequences of their actions cannot be controlled and will often 'feed back' in ways that necessitate new agentic interventions)."

997-8:  "*problematization*, *decision*, and *execution*, all of which require the contextualization of projects or of habitual practices within the concrete circumstances of the moment. We also describe two secondary tones: the actor's relationship to the past is based upon the *characterization* of a given situation against the background of past patterns of experience; and the relationship to the future is characterized by *deliberation* over possible trajectories of action, in which actors consider alternative hypothetical scenarios by critically evaluating the consequences of implementing this within real-world situations."

1002:  "The challenge here is to analyze the variable nature of the *interplay* between structure and agency, rather than to understand these as either standing in insurmountable opposition, or, as in currently influential theorizations, being 'mutually constitutive' in a direct and stable way."

1004:  "What becomes eclipsed in the notion of inseparability of structure and agency is the degree of changeability or mutability of different actual structures, as well as *the variable (and changing) ways in which social actors relate to them*."

1004:  "We might therefore speak of the *double constitution of agency and structure*: temporal-relational contexts support particular agentic orientations, which in turn constitute different structuring relationships of actors towards their environments. It is the constitution of such orientations within particular structural contexts that gives form to effort and allows actors to assume greater or lesser degrees of transformative leverage in relation to the structuring contexts of action."

1004:  "a threefold differentiation between agency, action, and structure. […] there are no concrete agents, but only actors who engage agentically with their structuring environments."

1004:  "All social action is a concrete synthesis, shaped and conditioned, on the one hand, by the temporal-relational contexts of action and, on the other, by the dynamic element of agency itself. The latter guarantees that empirical social action will never be *completely* determined or structured. On the other hand, there is no hypothetical moment in which agency actually gets 'free' of structure; it is not, in other words, some pure Kantian transcendental will."

1006:  "The goal here is to locate particular packages of commonly occurring structure-agency relationships, across a wide range of historical, institutional, and interpersonal contexts."

1006:  "the *temporal* dimension of sociality: actors engaged in emergent events find themselves positioned between the old and the new and are thus forced to develop new ways of integrating past and future perspectives. We can formulate this as an exploratory proposition, a probabilistic axis along which to direct empirical research: *Actors who face changing situations that demand (or facilitate) the reconstruction of temporal perspectives can expand their capacity for imaginative and/or deliberative response*."

1007:  "*Actors who are positioned at the intersection of multiple temporal-relational contexts can develop greater capacities for creative and critical intervention*."

1008:  "*Actors who feel creative and deliberative while in the flow of unproblematic trajectories can often be highly reproductive of received contexts*."

1009:  "*Actors who feel blocked in encountering problematic situations can actually be pioneers in exploring and reconstructing contexts of action*."

1010:  "*By subjecting their own agentic orientations to imaginative recomposition and critical judgment, actors can loosen themselves from past patterns of interaction and reframe their relationships to existing constraints*."
