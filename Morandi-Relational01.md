209:  Sociology claims to be "both a science and knowledge of human reality"

212:  "relation, in being a property, cannot be reduced to a narrow perspective, i.e. the sociological view, but belongs to the structure of social phenomena in that they are social."

212:  "Relation is the causal relationship of social reality, for causality always implies a relation to its effects."

213:  "the relational theory of society can maintain that the objects of its study are not relations among social facts but social facts as relations, because it calls attention to the property of the causal sphere implying relations between the elements of the finalistic process."

214:  "Sociologically, it is pivotal to consider that these elements are always *in relation* and that social processes differ according to the 'way' the relation is established, not according to the relation itself, which is always necessary, irrespective of contingency."

216:  "through their doings, agents produce effects, but their agency is ordered by pre-existent intended purposes."
