Introduction
---

1:  "Sociology is founded on the belief that our behaviour is causally influenced and in particular that there are *social* factors that influence our behaviour. […] Conventionally, the social factors that are held to influence our behaviour are known as *social structure*, a concept that even today remains implicit in, and indeed essential to, much of the work done in the social sciences."

2:  "Individualists about structure, it would seem, must be voluntarists about agency, while it is often believed that those who attribute causal significance to social structure must be determinists about agency."

4:  "Drawing on the theory of emergence, it argues that instead of ascribing causal significance to an abstract notion of social structure or a monolithic concept of society, we must recognise that it is specific groups of people that have social structural power. As I understand it, the social world is composed of many overlapping and intersecting groups, each of which has the causal power to influence human individuals. But in each case these powers depend on interactions between individual members of the group, and this argument thus depends in turn on the claim that human individuals themselves also possess causal powers---human agency. Social events, then, are produced by the interaction of *both* structural and agential causal power."

5:  "The value of the concept of emergence lies in its potential to explain how an entity can have a causal impact on the world in its own right: a causal impact that is not just the sum of the impacts its parts would have if they were not organised into this kind of whole. I shall call the capability of having such an impact a *causal power* of the entity concerned."

6:  "Emergent powers only exist when the parts concerned are organised into the type of whole that has these powers and hence they are powers of the whole and not of the parts. One implication of this argument is that explaining the *mechanism* behind a causal power does not explain away the power. On the contrary, it may help to justify our belief that it is causally significant."

7:  "there *are* social entities that possess causal powers, but that these entities are *not* whole societies. Instead, there are many different social entities, and indeed a number of different kinds of social entities, that possess social powers. What they have in common is that they are groups of people: people are their parts."

8:  "social events are also multiply determined and that in order to offer plausible explanations of them, we need to identify the multiple causal powers that are interacting to produce them, and indeed how those powers interact---how they interfere with each other or reinforce each other, for example."

Chapter 2: Emergence
---

16:  "For thinkers in this relational tradition, emergent properties are defined as properties or powers of a whole that are not possessed by its parts."

16:  "we must clarify what is meant by *wholes* and *parts*. Both wholes and parts in the basic definition above are *entities*, and the terms *whole* and *part* therefore describe roles played by particular entities in particular cases (an entity that is a whole in one context can be a part in another)."

17:  "an entity may be defined as *a persistent whole formed from a set of parts that is structured by the relations between these parts*."

17:  "A property is some intrinsic aspect of an entity that can have a causal impact on the world. I use *intrinsic* in order to exclude purely formal relations with other entities, such as 'larger than *x*', from definitions of properties. *Properties* and *powers* may therefore be regarded as synonyms."

17:  "Emergence occurs when a whole possesses one or more *emergent properties*. An emergent property is one that is not possessed by any of the parts individually and that would not be possessed by the full set of parts in the absence of a structuring set of relations between them."

17:  "Emergent properties may be contrasted with *resultant properties*---these are properties of a whole that *are* possessed by its parts in isolation, or in an unstructured aggregation." (e.g., mass of whole = mass of parts individually; averages of groups, such as height, age, weight)

19:  "In considering any individual entity, then, it may be useful to represent its structure as a number of layers, each being a successive decomposition of the whole into its parts (see the discussion of *lamination* in chapter 3)."

23:  "The relation between a whole and its parts is thus a relation of composition, and not of causation."

23:  "Nevertheless, we can often explain how the relation or interaction between the parts produces the overall effect. This process of interaction between the parts may be called the *mechanism* or *generative mechanism* that produces the emergent property concerned."

24:  Redescription principle: "the principle that *if* we explain a causal power in terms of (a) the parts of an entity *H*; plus (b) the relations between those parts that pertain only when they are organised into the form of an *H*; *then* because we have explained the power in terms of a combination---the parts and relations---that exists only when an *H* exists, we have not eliminated *H* from our explanation. The entities that are *H*'s parts would not have this causal power if they were not organised into an *H*, hence it is a causal power of *H* and not of the parts. The *lower-level* account of *H*'s powers merely *redescribes* the whole, which remains implicit in the explanation."

28:  "the structure acts *through* the person and the person *implements* the structure's causal power."

33:  "For an entity to have emergent properties, it must first of all exist, and the concepts of morphogenesis and morphostasis are used in explaining how this comes to be. All entities depend for their continued existence on the maintenance of their parts in the particular set of relations that is required to constitute the whole from them: on their *morphostasis*. We can express this by saying that each type of entity has its own characteristic set of *compositional consistency requirements*. […] Every different type of entity has a different set of such compositional consistency requirements and a corresponding structural range."

35:  "although it is clearly necessary for there to be a morphogenetic explanation of the coming into existence of any given higher-level entity, there is a sense in which it is the morphostatic explanations of its continuity of structure that provide the critical basis for emergence."

35:  "Some such morphostatic causes may be particularly strong: persistent entities are not just accidentally sustained but often arise from combinations of parts that have strong tendencies to cling together in a stable configuration. This makes the entities concerned highly resistant to destruction. Nevertheless, such resistance is always a causal achievement; it cannot be taken for granted as if there were some natural tendency to stability."

37:  "In general, morphogenesis encompasses processes that (a) contribute to the initial development or creation of any entity; and (b) contribute to the subsequent modification of its form within the structural range of the entity type."

39:  Five conditions an entity said to have emergent properties must meet: "(a) what are its parts?; (b) what are the relations between those parts that are characteristic of this particular type of entity?; (c) what set of morphogenetic causes has produced the entity in its current form?; (d) what set of morphostatic causes stabilises the entity and ensures its continued survival?; and (e) through what mechanisms do its parts and relations produce the specific properties of the entity?'

Chapter 3: Cause
---

41:  Rejecting the idea of "covering law" deriving from Hume and Hempel. "The 'covering law' model of causality interprets such regularities as exceptionless *laws* that enable us to deduce what will occur whenever the preconditions for the law to operate are present."

41:  Hume speaks of constant conjunction (A goes with B, but it is impossible to say that A causes B); Hempel develops this view: "In this model, cause is again nothing more than the law-like (*nomological*) claim than an event of type A is always followed by an event of type B. Given that this is the case, he argues, we can *deduce* that when A occurs, B will follow, and the predict an event of type B."

46:  "the idea that there are *real but not actual* causal powers implies that it was always true that if an entity of a given type appeared it would have the powers that follow from its characteristic parts and structure."

46:  "the first appearance of an entity of a given type does not *create* the (real but not actual) causal powers of that type but merely instantiates them, just as subsequent appearances do."

47:  "mechanisms and powers do not generate exceptionless regularities; rather, they operate as *tendencies*."

47:  Multiple causation: "Outside the closed systems of the laboratory, multiple causal powers constantly interact with each other."

47:  "actual events are always the product of an unruly mess of interacting powers that happen to rub up against one another at that particular moment and place."

47:  "When an event takes the form of a change in a thing, this change may depend not only on the ability of the 'affecting' entity to have an impact, but also on a *liability* of the 'affected' entity to be affected in this particular way. Rocks, for example, have a liability to be eroded by wind and rain, whereas oceans do not. Liabilities, however, are simply a variant of emergent causal power---a power to change in certain ways in response to certain kinds of stimulus."

48:  "On the one hand, we must identify causal powers. We may need to observe partial empirical regularities---what Lawson calls *demi-regularities* or *demi-regs*---in order to be able to hypothesise these. This analysis of demi-regs allows us to theorize the existence of underlying causal mechanisms that are responsible, subject to circumstances, for the observable degree of regularity---a process that critical realists have labelled *retroduction*. On the other hand, to explain specific events, we must identify the set of causal powers that interacted to produce them and how they affected each other---a process that critical realists have labelled *retrodiction*. These two processes are complementary because the real causal powers identified by retroduction become building blocks in the retrodictive construction of explanations of actual events."

49:  "Now, for most purposes, when we discuss any given entity we are in the habit of ignoring the role of its parts. To treat an entity in this way is to take what I propose to call a *level abstracted* view of it---a view that considers the effects of the whole entity in isolation from the existence or effects of its parts. I argue, however, that for some purposes we sometimes need to treat a whole entity quite explicitly as a stratified ensemble of parts at various ontological levels. This is to take what I propose to call a *laminated* view of the entity."

53-4:  "To be a reductionist (or, to be more precise, an *eliminative reductionist*) about a causal claim is to argue that the claim is false because the real causal influences emanate not from the claimed source but from some lower-level source."

54:  "in an explanatory reduction, the higher-level claim is explained by showing how it arises from lower-level elements and the relations between them, but this is not taken to entail that the higher-level claim can be eliminated."

54:  "emergent causal powers cannot be eliminatively reduced"

55:  "A coherent reductionism must not only *dismiss* arguments for the causal effectiveness of higher levels, but also *establish* some for the causal effectiveness of lower levels."

55:  Any case that is made against emergence *in general* undermines the ontological basis of lower-level explanations just as much as that of higher-level explanations: these eliminative reductionists are merrily sawing off the branch upon which they sit."

Chapter 4: Social Ontology and Social Structure
---

66:  "in so far as it describes something that is causally effective in the social world, the concept of *social structure* refers to *the causal powers of specific social groups*."

66:  "Entities are wholes---to put it crudely, things---composed of other entities, which are their *parts*. […] each entity is a kind of laminated hierarchy of the smaller entities of which it is composed."

66:  "Entities may possess *real causal powers*, which may also be called *emergent properties* of the entity. […] a causal power or emergent property is a capability of an entity to have a certain causal effect on the world in its own right---and effect that is something more than the effects that would be produced by the entity's parts if they were not organised into this sort of whole."

66-7:  "Emergent properties are the product of *causal mechanisms*. Causal mechanisms are processes that depend upon interactions between the parts, interactions that only occur when those parts are organised in the particular *relations* that constitutes them into wholes that possess this emergent property."

67:  "emergentist ontologies can resolve the problem of reductionism: they allow higher-level properties to be explained scientifically (an *explanatory reduction*), but they do not allow them to be replaced with properties of the parts in causal explanations (an *eliminative* or *ontological reduction*)."

67:  "Relational emergence is a synchronic relationship that requires a counterfactual explanation. It describes a particular sort of relation between a whole and its parts at a given moment in time: the relation of being composed by those parts but also possessing properties that the parts would not possess if they were not organised into such a whole."

67:  "The existence of an entity at any given point in time is always contingent; it depends on a causal history in which *morphogenetic* and *morphostatic* causal factors operate. Morphogenetic factors are those that contribute to bringing about the existence of the entity in its current form and  morphostatic factors are those that contribute to sustaining that existence over time."

68:  "*Events*, finally, are caused by interactions between the causal powers of the entities involved. Thus they are not usually determined by a single causal power or a single *law* as in Hempel's nomological-deductive model of causation, but rather they are *multiply determined* or co-determined by a variety of interacting powers, which may be possessed by entities at a variety of levels of the hierarchy of composition."

68:  "To summarise, an emergentist ontology identifies a number of *structural elements* that we would expect to find in any object of scientific enquiry: *entities*, made up of *parts* (which are themselves entities), organised by particular *relations* between the parts and possessing *emergent properties* in virtue of these relations. In order to explain these entities, relations and properties, we need to identify the *mechanisms* by which the parts and relations produce the properties, the *morphogenetic causes* that bring this set of parts into this set of relations in the first place an the *morphostatic causes* that keep them so. And once we are equipped with these elements, we can go on to explain *events*, and sometimes even *regularities* or partial regularities, by showing how the emergent properties or causal powers of the entities concerned interact to co-determine these events."

71:  "For the social sciences, then, the task of determining what type of structural element any given concept might represent is often far from trivial. On the one hand, it can be immensely difficult. The complex inter-relations between human beings, non-human physical objects, social structures and cultural or conceptual systems in the social world make it extremely challenging to disentangle the entities and properties involved, and there are many competing schools of thought on many of these questions. On the other, resolving these questions is fundamental to resolving the ontological confusion in which these disciplines find themselves."

    Note: "human beings, non-human physical objects." Completely jumps over the gap between "human beings" and "things." That is, non-human animals and plants. Admittedly this is a list, but if we are speaking of "complex inter-relations," the underlying point of "complexity" is only strengthened when these beings are recognized.
    
71-2:  local complementarity test: "Regional ontologies are not made up of isolated entities, properties and the like; they are complementary networks of mutually consistent structural elements. Only when we have a plausible complementary *set* of such classifications, can we move on from this point."

72:  downward recursion test: follows from hierarchical/laminated nature of emergence. Entities decomposed into parts; those parts are entities themselves that must be decomposed; repeat until you reach a level where the entities are adequately described; e.g., signs = signified + signifiers, but what parts constitute signified and signifiers?

72-3:  retroduction test: "Realist regional theory is concerned with identifying the causal mechanisms underlying emergent properties (retroduction), and with explaining how these interact to produce events of interest (retrodiction). But it is impossible to identify mechanisms without identifying the property to be explained, the entity possessing it, and the characteristic set of parts and relations that underpin the mechanism. In other words, retroduction depends on filling out part of the related regional ontology."

73:  emergence level test: "implicit in the twin problems of reduction and reification." "*Any* attribution of causal powers to a particular level of the ontological hierarchy is open to *both* these challenges, and hence to validate our own claims regarding emergent properties and the mechanisms responsible for them, we must develop and apply criteria for identifying the levels at which properties emerge. In fact a single criterion allows us to avoid both untenable reductions and untenable reifications, and this criterion is already implicit in the general theory of emergence: a property is emergent at the level where the parts of the entity possessing it would not themselves have the property if they were not organised into this sort of whole."

75:  metatheory test: "We validate *theory* by working out its implications for the actual world in the form of hypotheses that can be tested against empirical evidence, and then revise the theory if it proves inadequate to the case. In a metamethodological parallel, we can validate *metatheory* by working out its implications for the development of theory in the form of methodological inferences that can then be tested in the process of theorising. Just as we should should be prepared to revise theory that proves inadequate, we should be prepared to revise metatheory if *it* proves inadequate."

75-6:  summary of the five tests:

1. *the local complementarity test*---make a hypothesis as to the type of structural element a concept of interest represents, then validate this by working out the complementary structural elements implicit in this hypothesis; if any of the latter are empirically untenable, revise your initial hypothesis and try again;
2. *the downward recursion test*---when your hypothesis claims that a concept represents a type of entity identify the parts of this entity and ensure that these in turn are plausibly defined as entities, following the hierarchy of composition all the way down to a level that has a well-substantiated entity status;
3. *the retroduction test*---when your hypothesis claims that a concept represents a type of property, identify the mechanism responsible for the property and the parts and relations on which the mechanism depends; having done so, return to the first iteration technique;
4. *the emergence level test*---in addition, when your hypothesis suggests a property, validate the level at which the property emerges, by applying the criterion that a property is emergent at the level where the parts of the entity possessing it would not themselves have the property if they were not organised into this sort of whole; and
5. *the metatheory test*---when this method seems to lead to untenable conclusions, consider revising the method and perhaps the underlying general ontology.

81:  "it may be implied that social structure-as-relations can be causally effective. Yet relations alone cannot have causal powers; indeed a relation cannot exist at all in the absence of the things related. It is only when specific entities (and thus specific causal powers) enter into a relationship that causal consequence can follow."

81:  "Ultimately, then, the idea that structures have causal powers is incoherent if structure is taken to mean structures-as-relations and not structures-as-wholes."

82:  "we can only make sense of social structure by reinstating this sense of structure-as-whole and identifying the social *entities* that can possess causal powers. These are the entities that are *structured by* structure-as-relations, that *possess* the properties sometimes misleadingly identified as structures themselves and that *cause* those (partial) empirical regularities sometimes misidentified as structures."

82:  "The coherence of any bounded concept of society is extremely problematic. Those who use the concept often seem to assume that a society is co-terminous with the territory controlled by a particular state. States themselves may well control territory with well-defined spatial boundaries, at least in some respects. But they do not map neatly onto *societies*; there are many potential cross-cutting social systems that follow different boundaries, or none at all."

82:  "Given the lack of coherence of the concept of society, it is hard to see how such a poorly defined entity could have real causal powers."

Chapter 5: Agency
---

87:  "human individuals do indeed have causal powers of our own, and that those causal powers are emergent properties."

87:  "Human action may be affected by social causes without being *fully determined* by them."

89:  "Human individuals, I argue, have emergent causal powers. For the purpose of explaining how societies work, the most important of these powers is our generic power to act, including our powers to act communicatively."

95:  "I suggest that *all* decision making works as follows: that we do make conscious decisions but these decisions are only the *indirect* and *partial* causes of our behaviour, in that (a) they occur in a variable length of time before the action concerned; and (b) they are always incomplete regarding the details of the action to be taken."

96:  "Thus any single case of human behaviour may represent the (full or partial) realisation of a series of nested decisions of various sizes or scope."

96:  "Decisions, then, do not seem to produce behaviour directly, but rather produce dispositions to behave in a given way in the future in certain circumstances. Indeed, we may define a *decision* as an event in which an episode of conscious reflection (a process) leads to changes in our dispositions (our tendencies to behave in particular ways). These dispositions then seem to be held with varying degrees of commitment, through being implemented in the brain as neural networks, in analogous way to beliefs that we hold with varying degrees of confidence."

97:  four steps to the decision making model:

1. *experience*: as a result of our experience we develop beliefs and also sometimes unconsciously acquire dispositions to act in certain ways, which are implemented at the neural level as neural networks;
2. *decision making*: we possess the power to think consciously about our plans, beliefs and dispositions, and make decisions, which are co-determined causally by our thinking powers and the network of beliefs that they work upon;
3. *decision storage*: having made decisions, these are stored in our neural networks as new or modified dispositions (note that there may be multiple loops back to step 2 before an action eventually occurs, including the 'last-minute' conscious review of some of our decisions); and,
4. *action implementation*: our actions are determined directly and immediately by non-conscious brain processes that use our beliefs, previous decisions and skills as inputs.

97:  "the most balanced story is one in which our conscious decision-making and our non-conscious behaviour determination appear as complementary and mutually necessary components in the causation of our actions."

98:  "*reasons* can be causes of our actions, but they are only ever partial and contingent causes. Reasons are emergent mental properties (and thus causal powers of the individual concerned) that co-determine our *decisions* and decisions are stored in our brains as neural configurations---dispositions---which in turn co-determine our actions."

102:  "Archer's account of human *social* action places conscious reflexive deliberation at its heart (although not her account of actions in the *natural* and *practical* orders)."

103:  "There is a strongly humanistic element to Archer's stress on the conscious nature of our reflexive deliberations and the opportunity that they present us to make decisions for ourselves about how we will conduct our lives."

Chapter 6: Normative Institutions
---

116:  "Normative intersectionality arises when an individual is part of multiple distinct norm circles that have different boundaries."

116:  "By *normative social practices* I mean regularised practices encouraged by dispositions or beliefs about appropriate ways of behaving that are shared by a group of people."

117:  "These various types of rules [e.g., legal, religious, rules of the game, cultural] (or their equivalent, in which the practice is not understood or transmitted in explicitly verbal terms) may be called *norms*."

117:  "The social structures that are responsible for normative social practices are generally referred to in the sociological literature as *social institutions*."

121-2:  "I will be following Latour's advice to trace the associations at work, but instead of tracing these associations with a view to *substituting* them for a social structure, I will be tracing them with a view to *explaining* how that social structure works."

122:  "normative social institutions are emergent properties---causal powers---of *normative circles*."

122-7:  "Let us consider, then, the case of a single social institution, in which a single norm tends to produce a single social practice. Part of the mechanism by which the practice is produced is that each member of the group that enacts this practice, which I shall call the *norm circle*, holds a normative belief or disposition endorsing the practice. This does not necessarily entail that each member of the group is morally committed to the norm as representing a just standard of [123] behaviour; it entails only that they are aware at some level that they are expected to observe it and will face positive consequences when they do so, or negative ones when they do not. The example abstracts from a variety of possible complexities by assuming a rather simple sort of social institution: one in which every member of the norm circle both endorses the norm and is expected to observe it. This enables us to ignore, for the purpose of clarifying the mechanism, features that would be important in a fuller account of normative institutions, most particularly the question of differences of social power between members of the circle and therefore the possibility that they could be used to enforce social practices that advantaged some at the expense of others.
"The entity to which I am ascribing normative power in this argument is the norm circle and we can understand the *social institution* concerned as the causal power that this circle has to tend to produce the corresponding practice through the influence it exerts on its members. Like all causal powers in the critical realist model, normative institutions do not *determine* behaviour but only *contribute* causally to its determination, alongside other causal powers with which they interact, and hence they only *tend* to produce a given outcome […]. The parts of the circle, I suggest, are the individuals who are its members. But what is the mechanism by which the circle (as opposed to simply the individuals) generates this causal power?
"Although institutions depend on the members of the norm circle sharing a similar understanding of the norm concerned, emergent or collective properties cannot be produced by such formal similarities […]. It is the commitment that they have to *endorse and enforce* the practice with each other that makes a norm circle more effective than the sum of its members would be if they were not part of it. The members of a norm circle are aware that its other members share that commitment, they may feel an obligation to them to endorse and enforce the norm concerned and they have an expectation that the others will support them when they do so. In other words, the members of a norm circle share a *collective intention* to support the norm, and as a result they each tend to support it more actively than they would if they did not share that collective intention. [124]
"They may support the norm by advocating the practice, by praising it or rewarding those who enact it, by criticising or punishing those who fail to enact it, or even just by ostentatiously enacting it themselves. The consequence of such endorsement and enforcement is that the members of the circle know that they face a systematic incentive to enact the practice. Not only will other individual members of the circle take an incentivising stance, but when they do so they will be taken to be acting on behalf of the circle as a whole and will be supported by other members of it. It is this commitment to endorse and enforce the norm that is the characteristic *relation* between members of a norm circle.
"As a consequence of being members of a norm circle, then, these individuals act differently than they would do otherwise. Even if they held the same normative belief, they would not necessarily act in the same ways regarding it (either endorsing it so strongly or enacting it so frequently) if they were not part of a circle that shares a commitment to endorse and observe the norm. These relations, then, when combined with these sorts of parts, provide a generative mechanism that gives the norm circle an emergent property or causal power: the tendency to increase conformity of its members to the norm. The property is the institution and the causal power is the capability that the group has to affect the behaviour of individuals. That causal power is implemented *through* the members of the group, although it is a a power *of* the group, and when its members act in support of the norm, it is the group (as well as the member concerned) that acts.
"Now, this is not to deny any significance to the normative beliefs of the individuals concerned. Indeed, it is one of the strengths of the emergentist perspective that it accepts that entities at many levels of a laminated whole can simultaneously have causal powers and that these powers may interact to produce actual events. On this view, it is not only true that individual beliefs themselves are causally effective but also that they are a crucial part of the mechanism underpinning the causal power of the larger group. At the level of the individual, social institutions work because the individual knows both what the expected behaviour is and the pattern of incentives their behaviour is likely to confront. These beliefs tend to encourage the enactment of the practice concerned; but they take the form they do at least in part [125] because of the emergent causal effect of the norm circle. Individual beliefs, then, mediate between social institution and individual behaviour. Norm circles have a causal effect on beliefs (and indeed on unconscious dispositions, as stressed in Bourdieu's account of the *habitus*), and these in turn have a causal effect on individual behaviour […].
"This, then, is a case of downward causation. […] But in social institutions the power of the norm circle to influence an individual member's behaviour is not a direct physical effect. Normative compliance is not physically forced compliance but voluntary compliance; and hence it is *directly* caused, not by the *existence* in the present of normative pressures from the community, but by the individual's *internalisation* of past pressures in the form of beliefs or dispositions. The effect of social institutions on behaviour is therefore a two-stage causal process---in the first stage the norm circle has a (downward) causal impact on the individual's motivations and in the second these motivations affect their behaviour.
"The temporal gap between experience of the normative environment and the execution of a norm-compliant act is bridged by the retention of beliefs and dispositions shaped by this experience […]. Institutions work, in other words, by changing individuals---by changing their beliefs or dispositions so that the individuals will be inclined to behave in a different way. Their causal effect is on our motivations, not directly on our actions, by by affecting our motivations at one point in time they are able to affect our actions later---an argument that echoes Archer's point 'that structure and agency operate at different time periods.'
"None of this implies, however, that normative institutions necessarily rest on evaluative *consensus*. The argument does not entail that members of the norm group share a similar understanding of the norms they are expected to observe and the array of likely responses to their observation or non-observation of them. But there is no necessity that those affected by any given institution agree with the norm concerned in the sense of being *privately* committed to it as a just standard of [126] behaviour. This therefore leaves open two important possibilities: (a) that conformance with norms may sometimes be a consequence of prudential behaviour in the face of unequal power relations rather than consensus over the value of the norm; and (b) that members of the norm group who disagree with its standards (even if they do actually conform with them) may take action directed towards changing those standards, thus initiating the morphogenetic cycle of structural (and indeed cultural) change analysed by Archer […].
"Nor does my argument entail that these institutional influences *necessarily* produce norm compliance. An individual's recognition of the social institution may produce a tendency to comply with the relevant norm, but because their behaviour like all actual events is multiply determined, other causal factors---such as other conflicting normative motivations, the belief that a norm could be transgressed without being detected, or strong motivational drives---interact with this tendency and may lead to it not being realised in any given target act. A parent may steal a loaf to feed his or her hungry children, for example, despite recognising the risk of being punished for doing so and even despite believing it is wrong to steal as a result of experiencing previous advocacy of this norm.
"Furthermore, the existence of a social institution does not entail that all members of the normative circle concerned will actually endorse or enforce the norm on every relevant occasion: this sort of behaviour is also the outcome of many interacting factors, of which commitment to the norm is only one. Thus, for example, a member of the circle may fail to support a norm that needs to be supported in the particular circumstances, or because they are showing personal favouritism to an offender, or because they will obtain some personal benefit from a transgression of the norm by someone else.
"The existence of a social institution, then, may not lead to enforcement of the corresponding norm on every occasion, but it does imply that there will be a *tendency* for members of the community concerned to endorse/enforce the norm. The institution produces a conditional tendency: *if* an individual transgresses against the norm, they are *likely* to encounter negative sanctions as a result.
"This account of social institutions shares a great deal with Durkheim as well as with Simmel. As we have seen, [Durkheim] argued that 'Society [127] speaks through the mouth of those who affirm [its rules] in our presence: when we them, we hear society speak, and the collective voice has a resonance that a single voice cannot have'. [Durkheim] also tells us that 'social pressure exerts its influence mentally', and that such influence 'emanates from society'. We need simply substitute 'norm circle' for 'society' and this would read as a summary of my own argument. Given Durkheim's own emergentist leanings […] this is not entirely surprising.
"But this does not mean that *norm circle* is just a euphemism for *society*. This is not an unacceptable return to the 'sociology of the social', for at least two reasons. First, because there may be many norm circles in any social space, which can and frequently do intersect diversely with each other, and the consequence is that we can no longer take for granted any correspondence between a norm circle and any given social totality. Secondly, because now we have an explanation of the *mechanism* by which the interactions between people *produce* the power of the whole."

127:  "First, we might say that for any given normative disposition or belief held by any given individual, the norm circle is the set of actual individuals who have influenced that disposition. This is what I propose to call the *proximal* norm circle. Each person has a proximal norm circle for each of their normative beliefs or dispositions---the set of people who influenced its formation."

128:  "This second version depends on the individual's beliefs (conscious or otherwise) about the extent of the norm circle. I shall call this the *imagined* norm circle. […] It is important to recognise, however, that *imagined* communities are not *imaginary*. What is imagined is not the *existence* of the community, but its extent: its size and its boundaries. The individual experiencing the attentions of a proximal norm circle learns that they represent a wider group, but the extent of that group may remain obscure."

128:  "Thirdly, we might seek to establish the network of interlinked individuals who actually do endorse and enforce the norm concerned, irrespective of whether the individual has had any contact with them, as long as the individuals in his or her proximal norm circle are part of that wider network. I shall call this the *actual* norm circle. It comprises all those interlinked individuals who would in fact tend to endorse and enforce the norm concerned if they were to interact with the individual. This group may be either larger or smaller than the *imagined* norm circle for any individual holding the norm."

129:  "It is the individual's interactions with the *proximal* norm circle, for example, that directly produce his or her disposition to act in conformance with the norm. […] Each proximal norm circle, in effect, acts causally, but does so on behalf of the whole actual norm circle."

129:  "The *imagined* norm circle is causally significant because the presence (or consideration) of members of the imagined circle will tend to produce the individual's conformity with the norm."

129:  "And the *actual* norm circle is causally significant because it determines whether and when the individual will be subjected to the endorsement and enforcement of the norm, irrespective of the expectations about such endorsement that arise from their sense of the imagined norm circle."

129:  "The extent of the actual norm circle, it should be clear, is independent of the beliefs about it held by any given individual. The two are ontologically distinct. One important corollary of this ontological separation is that the individual can be wrong about the normative environment that they face. Indeed, our empirical knowledge that people can indeed be wrong about their normative environment is further evidence for the ontological distinction between imagined and actual norm circles."

131:  "*intersectionality* is the property that a group has when it intersects with one or more other groups by virtue of having one or more (but not all) members in common, or the property that a set of groups has when they intersect with each other. This is manifested at the individual level in the shape of people who are members of multiple groups simultaneously."

131:  "refers not just to intersections between nominal categories, but to individuals as being parts of multiple distinct social entities with real causal powers."

131-2:  "Intersectionality between actual norm circles is possible because individuals hold multiple normative beliefs and dispositions, and there is no necessity that the actual norm circle that endorses and enforces any given norm should map onto (i.e., be congruent with) those for other norms that are held by the same individual. Any given person, in respect of *each* distinct belief or disposition they hold, is influenced by a given norm circle. It may, however, often be the case that these individual-disposition-specific norm circles are congruent for particular sets of linked dispositions for any one individual. Thus, for example, a member of a religious community may hold a cluster of normative beliefs that are endorsed and enforced only by that community. In such cases, I call the group that endorses and enforces this cluster of norms a *norm-set-circle*. More generally, I shall use the term *normative circle* to refer to both *norm circles* for single norms and also *norm-set circles*."

133:  "individuals become sites of normative intersectionality and *society* becomes a patchwork of overlapping or intersecting normative circles."

133:  "A theory that simply argues that institutional pressures *determine* individual action is no longer tenable when institutional pressures may counteract each other; at best we can only argue that such pressures *tend* to influence action in certain directions. And once we recognise that multiple such pressures may conflict with each other, then we must recognise the need for individuals in ambivalent normative positions to make *decisions* about which norms to observe in difficult situations. Hence the importance of an understanding of human action that leaves room both for social influence and individual decision making, or, to put it in other terms, that reconciles the roles of both *habitus* and reflexivity […]."

135:  "Because there are always reasons why *some* norm transgressions do not meet with norm-enforcing reactions […] there is always a degree of uncertainty about the current normative environment, though with stable institutions the balance of support for the prevailing norms will tend to be clear enough for all competent members of the group to understand them. However, because it is possible for other factors to intervene causally in the agential moment, it is possible that the cycle reproducing any given institution may be subverted often enough for the norm to start to weaken, to fade away or to be transformed."

136:  "Opportunities for normative change are enormously enhanced in contexts of complex normative intersectionality. If the individuals in a given social space are all socialise with the same complete set of norms then the triggers for normative innovation are relatively limited---perhaps new kinds of situation may develop that call for new norms and perhaps tensions between different norms within the set may generate new normative thinking. In such contexts, the rate of normative change might be expected to be rather low. But where there are not only multiple sets of norms (for the same issue) within the social space but also large numbers of individuals who are subjected to pressures to conform with multiple sets, then the scope for normative change would seem to be higher. Individuals who are influenced by a number of normative circles may find it relatively easy to change their position on a particular normative question from that endorsed by one circle to that endorsed by another. By contrast, where a normative change would require the individual to leave a total normative community to join another, or would require the whole community to change its beliefs on a question, such changes seem likely to face greater inertia."

145:  "On the one hand, the structure of organisations depends on the *roles* that their members occupy and these roles are essentially bundles of norms. Organisations are therefore fundamentally dependent on normative social institutions and thus the causal powers of norm circles. Some theorists have argued, on grounds like these, that organizations simply *are* social institutions, but I argue in this chapter that although there are many interesting and important interdependencies between organisations and institutions, they remain different sorts of things. They are different because the roles of members of organisations lead them to interact in ways that result in *further*, non-normative mechanisms, mechanisms that give organisations quite different sorts of causal powers that those possessed by norm circles."

146:  "in at least some interaction situations, the participants may form a group with emergent causal powers and hence it [this section] will refer to the group of involved in an interaction situation as an *interaction group*."

149:  "I define an *association* as a group of two or more people who have a continuing commitment to the group as such and not just to any normative institutions that the group may happen to instantiate. Perhaps the key respect in which associations differ from interaction groups is that as a result of this commitment the group can persist beyond the duration of a single interaction situation."

152:  "In general, organisations are a type of association: they are groups of people who have a continuing commitment to the organisation as such. However, organisations tend to be more complex than the simple sorts of association discussed so far in this chapter, in at least two significant dimensions. First, they tend to be strongly structured by specialised *roles*; and secondly, they are marked by significant *authority* relations between at least some of these roles."

153:  "Any organisation, I argue, is an entity composed of a group of human individuals, structured by a set of relationships between them (although I shall suggest below that they may also sometimes have non-human parts). These relationships are formalised in the *roles* or *social positions* occupied by the people in the organisation. Role descriptions implicitly or explicitly specify norms that define how an incumbent of the position concerned must relate to other members of the organisation and also how they must relate to outsiders when acting on behalf of the organisation. Some of these norms may be written down in formal job descriptions but roles may also be defined partly by less formal sets of expectations that other members of the organisation have of their incumbents."

153:  "roles are not entities; rather, roles define relations between people. Roles, therefore, are not composed of parts (though we may think of them as bundles of relations), but instead are occupied by actual people."

157:  "Indeed, there is no necessity that it is only human individuals that interact to produce these effects. The barbershop quartet may depend only on human individuals to produce its sound (at least in a synchronic sense and assuming an appropriate environment---one with air to breathe and vibrate, for example). But the pin producers need their tools; in a sense the power of the pin factory to produce pins at a certain is a power of an entity that includes both workers and their tools. If this is so, then the organisation here is a kind of hybrid entity: an entity that includes both people and other material things as its parts, and that depends on relations between both people and those other things to produce its emergent properties."

158:  "When a role incumbent does act in the role, she adopts behaviours that have been specified by the organisation, as a result of acquiring a normative belief or disposition: the belief that role incumbents ought to act as specified by the normas that make up their role. The role incumbent, that is, is altered as an individual as a result of accepting the role in the organisation and thus we have a case of what was described in chapter 2 as *intrastructuration*. In such cases, we can say that the higher-leve entity, in this case the organisation, acts *through* the individual; those properties that the individual acquires by occupying their role are essentially properties of the organisation localised in the individual."
