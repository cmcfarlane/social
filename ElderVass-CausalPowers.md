Introduction
---

1:  "Sociology is founded on the belief that our behaviour is causally influenced and in particular that there are *social* factors that influence our behaviour. […] Conventionally, the social factors that are held to influence our behaviour are known as *social structure*, a concept that even today remains implicit in, and indeed essential to, much of the work done in the social sciences."

2:  "Individualists about structure, it would seem, must be voluntarists about agency, while it is often believed that those who attribute causal significance to social structure must be determinists about agency."

4:  "Drawing on the theory of emergence, it argues that instead of ascribing causal significance to an abstract notion of social structure or a monolithic concept of society, we must recognise that it is specific groups of people that have social structural power. As I understand it, the social world is composed of many overlapping and intersecting groups, each of which has the causal power to influence human individuals. But in each case these powers depend on interactions between individual members of the group, and this argument thus depends in turn on the claim that human individuals themselves also possess causal powers---human agency. Social events, then, are produced by the interaction of *both* structural and agential causal power."

5:  "The value of the concept of emergence lies in its potential to explain how an entity can have a causal impact on the world in its own right: a causal impact that is not just the sum of the impacts its parts would have if they were not organised into this kind of whole. I shall call the capability of having such an impact a *causal power* of the entity concerned."

6:  "Emergent powers only exist when the parts concerned are organised into the type of whole that has these powers and hence they are powers of the whole and not of the parts. One implication of this argument is that explaining the *mechanism* behind a causal power does not explain away the power. On the contrary, it may help to justify our belief that it is causally significant."

7:  "there *are* social entities that possess causal powers, but that these entities are *not* whole societies. Instead, there are many different social entities, and indeed a number of different kinds of social entities, that possess social powers. What they have in common is that they are groups of people: people are their parts."

8:  "social events are also multiply determined and that in order to offer plausible explanations of them, we need to identify the multiple causal powers that are interacting to produce them, and indeed how those powers interact---how they interfere with each other or reinforce each other, for example."

Chapter 2: Emergence
---

16:  "For thinkers in this relational tradition, emergent properties are defined as properties or powers of a whole that are not possessed by its parts."

16:  "we must clarify what is meant by *wholes* and *parts*. Both wholes and parts in the basic definition above are *entities*, and the terms *whole* and *part* therefore describe roles played by particular entities in particular cases (an entity that is a whole in one context can be a part in another)."

17:  "an entity may be defined as *a persistent whole formed from a set of parts that is structured by the relations between these parts*."

17:  "A property is some intrinsic aspect of an entity that can have a causal impact on the world. I use *intrinsic* in order to exclude purely formal relations with other entities, such as 'larger than *x*', from definitions of properties. *Properties* and *powers* may therefore be regarded as synonyms."

17:  "Emergence occurs when a whole possesses one or more *emergent properties*. An emergent property is one that is not possessed by any of the parts individually and that would not be possessed by the full set of parts in the absence of a structuring set of relations between them."

17:  "Emergent properties may be contrasted with *resultant properties*---these are properties of a whole that *are* possessed by its parts in isolation, or in an unstructured aggregation." (e.g., mass of whole = mass of parts individually; averages of groups, such as height, age, weight)

19:  "In considering any individual entity, then, it may be useful to represent its structure as a number of layers, each being a successive decomposition of the whole into its parts (see the discussion of *lamination* in chapter 3)."

23:  "The relation between a whole and its parts is thus a relation of composition, and not of causation."

23:  "Nevertheless, we can often explain how the relation or interaction between the parts produces the overall effect. This process of interaction between the parts may be called the *mechanism* or *generative mechanism* that produces the emergent property concerned."

24:  Redescription principle: "the principle that *if* we explain a causal power in terms of (a) the parts of an entity *H*; plus (b) the relations between those parts that pertain only when they are organised into the form of an *H*; *then* because we have explained the power in terms of a combination---the parts and relations---that exists only when an *H* exists, we have not eliminated *H* from our explanation. The entities that are *H*'s parts would not have this causal power if they were not organised into an *H*, hence it is a causal power of *H* and not of the parts. The *lower-level* account of *H*'s powers merely *redescribes* the whole, which remains implicit in the explanation."

28:  "the structure acts *through* the person and the person *implements* the structure's causal power."

33:  "For an entity to have emergent properties, it must first of all exist, and the concepts of morphogenesis and morphostasis are used in explaining how this comes to be. All entities depend for their continued existence on the maintenance of their parts in the particular set of relations that is required to constitute the whole from them: on their *morphostasis*. We can express this by saying that each type of entity has its own characteristic set of *compositional consistency requirements*. […] Every different type of entity has a different set of such compositional consistency requirements and a corresponding structural range."

35:  "although it is clearly necessary for there to be a morphogenetic explanation of the coming into existence of any given higher-level entity, there is a sense in which it is the morphostatic explanations of its continuity of structure that provide the critical basis for emergence."

35:  "Some such morphostatic causes may be particularly strong: persistent entities are not just accidentally sustained but often arise from combinations of parts that have strong tendencies to cling together in a stable configuration. This makes the entities concerned highly resistant to destruction. Nevertheless, such resistance is always a causal achievement; it cannot be taken for granted as if there were some natural tendency to stability."

37:  "In general, morphogenesis encompasses processes that (a) contribute to the initial development or creation of any entity; and (b) contribute to the subsequent modification of its form within the structural range of the entity type."

39:  Five conditions an entity said to have emergent properties must meet: "(a) what are its parts?; (b) what are the relations between those parts that are characteristic of this particular type of entity?; (c) what set of morphogenetic causes has produced the entity in its current form?; (d) what set of morphostatic causes stabilises the entity and ensures its continued survival?; and (e) through what mechanisms do its parts and relations produce the specific properties of the entity?'

Chapter 3: Cause
---

41:  Rejecting the idea of "covering law" deriving from Hume and Hempel. "The 'covering law' model of causality interprets such regularities as exceptionless *laws* that enable us to deduce what will occur whenever the preconditions for the law to operate are present."

41:  Hume speaks of constant conjunction (A goes with B, but it is impossible to say that A causes B); Hempel develops this view: "In this model, cause is again nothing more than the law-like (*nomological*) claim than an event of type A is always followed by an event of type B. Given that this is the case, he argues, we can *deduce* that when A occurs, B will follow, and the predict an event of type B."

46:  "the idea that there are *real but not actual* causal powers implies that it was always true that if an entity of a given type appeared it would have the powers that follow from its characteristic parts and structure."

46:  "the first appearance of an entity of a given type does not *create* the (real but not actual) causal powers of that type but merely instantiates them, just as subsequent appearances do."

47:  "mechanisms and powers do not generate exceptionless regularities; rather, they operate as *tendencies*."

47:  Multiple causation: "Outside the closed systems of the laboratory, multiple causal powers constantly interact with each other."

47:  "actual events are always the product of an unruly mess of interacting powers that happen to rub up against one another at that particular moment and place."

47:  "When an event takes the form of a change in a thing, this change may depend not only on the ability of the 'affecting' entity to have an impact, but also on a *liability* of the 'affected' entity to be affected in this particular way. Rocks, for example, have a liability to be eroded by wind and rain, whereas oceans do not. Liabilities, however, are simply a variant of emergent causal power---a power to change in certain ways in response to certain kinds of stimulus."

48:  "On the one hand, we must identify causal powers. We may need to observe partial empirical regularities---what Lawson calls *demi-regularities* or *demi-regs*---in order to be able to hypothesise these. This analysis of demi-regs allows us to theorize the existence of underlying causal mechanisms that are responsible, subject to circumstances, for the observable degree of regularity---a process that critical realists have labelled *retroduction*. On the other hand, to explain specific events, we must identify the set of causal powers that interacted to produce them and how they affected each other---a process that critical realists have labelled *retrodiction*. These two processes are complementary because the real causal powers identified by retroduction become building blocks in the retrodictive construction of explanations of actual events."

49:  "Now, for most purposes, when we discuss any given entity we are in the habit of ignoring the role of its parts. To treat an entity in this way is to take what I propose to call a *level abstracted* view of it---a view that considers the effects of the whole entity in isolation from the existence or effects of its parts. I argue, however, that for some purposes we sometimes need to treat a whole entity quite explicitly as a stratified ensemble of parts at various ontological levels. This is to take what I propose to call a *laminated* view of the entity."

53-4:  "To be a reductionist (or, to be more precise, an *eliminative reductionist*) about a causal claim is to argue that the claim is false because the real causal influences emanate not from the claimed source but from some lower-level source."

54:  "in an explanatory reduction, the higher-level claim is explained by showing how it arises from lower-level elements and the relations between them, but this is not taken to entail that the higher-level claim can be eliminated."

54:  "emergent causal powers cannot be eliminatively reduced"

55:  "A coherent reductionism must not only *dismiss* arguments for the causal effectiveness of higher levels, but also *establish* some for the causal effectiveness of lower levels."

55:  Any case that is made against emergence *in general* undermines the ontological basis of lower-level explanations just as much as that of higher-level explanations: these eliminative reductionists are merrily sawing off the branch upon which they sit."

Chapter 4: Social Ontology and Social Structure
---

66:  "in so far as it describes something that is causally effective in the social world, the concept of *social structure* refers to *the causal powers of specific social groups*."

66:  "Entities are wholes---to put it crudely, things---composed of other entities, which are their *parts*. […] each entity is a kind of laminated hierarchy of the smaller entities of which it is composed."

66:  "Entities may possess *real causal powers*, which may also be called *emergent properties* of the entity. […] a causal power or emergent property is a capability of an entity to have a certain causal effect on the world in its own right---and effect that is something more than the effects that would be produced by the entity's parts if they were not organised into this sort of whole."

66-7:  "Emergent properties are the product of *causal mechanisms*. Causal mechanisms are processes that depend upon interactions between the parts, interactions that only occur when those parts are organised in the particular *relations* that constitutes them into wholes that possess this emergent property."

67:  "emergentist ontologies can resolve the problem of reductionism: they allow higher-level properties to be explained scientifically (an *explanatory reduction*), but they do not allow them to be replaced with properties of the parts in causal explanations (an *eliminative* or *ontological reduction*)."

67:  "Relational emergence is a synchronic relationship that requires a counterfactual explanation. It describes a particular sort of relation between a whole and its parts at a given moment in time: the relation of being composed by those parts but also possessing properties that the parts would not possess if they were not organised into such a whole."

67:  "The existence of an entity at any given point in time is always contingent; it depends on a causal history in which *morphogenetic* and *morphostatic* causal factors operate. Morphogenetic factors are those that contribute to bringing about the existence of the entity in its current form and  morphostatic factors are those that contribute to sustaining that existence over time."

68:  "*Events*, finally, are caused by interactions between the causal powers of the entities involved. Thus they are not usually determined by a single causal power or a single *law* as in Hempel's nomological-deductive model of causation, but rather they are *multiply determined* or co-determined by a variety of interacting powers, which may be possessed by entities at a variety of levels of the hierarchy of composition."

68:  "To summarise, an emergentist ontology identifies a number of *structural elements* that we would expect to find in any object of scientific enquiry: *entities*, made up of *parts* (which are themselves entities), organised by particular *relations* between the parts and possessing *emergent properties* in virtue of these relations. In order to explain these entities, relations and properties, we need to identify the *mechanisms* by which the parts and relations produce the properties, the *morphogenetic causes* that bring this set of parts into this set of relations in the first place an the *morphostatic causes* that keep them so. And once we are equipped with these elements, we can go on to explain *events*, and sometimes even *regularities* or partial regularities, by showing how the emergent properties or causal powers of the entities concerned interact to co-determine these events."

71:  "For the social sciences, then, the task of determining what type of structural element any given concept might represent is often far from trivial. On the one hand, it can be immensely difficult. The complex inter-relations between human beings, non-human physical objects, social structures and cultural or conceptual systems in the social world make it extremely challenging to disentangle the entities and properties involved, and there are many competing schools of thought on many of these questions. On the other, resolving these questions is fundamental to resolving the ontological confusion in which these disciplines find themselves."

    Note: "human beings, non-human physical objects." Completely jumps over the gap between "human beings" and "things." That is, non-human animals and plants. Admittedly this is a list, but if we are speaking of "complex inter-relations," the underlying point of "complexity" is only strengthened when these beings are recognized.
    
71-2:  local complementarity test: "Regional ontologies are not made up of isolated entities, properties and the like; they are complementary networks of mutually consistent structural elements. Only when we have a plausible complementary *set* of such classifications, can we move on from this point."

72:  downward recursion test: follows from hierarchical/laminated nature of emergence. Entities decomposed into parts; those parts are entities themselves that must be decomposed; repeat until you reach a level where the entities are adequately described; e.g., signs = signified + signifiers, but what parts constitute signified and signifiers?

72-3:  retroduction test: "Realist regional theory is concerned with identifying the causal mechanisms underlying emergent properties (retroduction), and with explaining how these interact to produce events of interest (retrodiction). But it is impossible to identify mechanisms without identifying the property to be explained, the entity possessing it, and the characteristic set of parts and relations that underpin the mechanism. In other words, retroduction depends on filling out part of the related regional ontology."

73:  emergence level test: "implicit in the twin problems of reduction and reification." "*Any* attribution of causal powers to a particular level of the ontological hierarchy is open to *both* these challenges, and hence to validate our own claims regarding emergent properties and the mechanisms responsible for them, we must develop and apply criteria for identifying the levels at which properties emerge. In fact a single criterion allows us to avoid both untenable reductions and untenable reifications, and this criterion is already implicit in the general theory of emergence: a property is emergent at the level where the parts of the entity possessing it would not themselves have the property if they were not organised into this sort of whole."

75:  metatheory test: "We validate *theory* by working out its implications for the actual world in the form of hypotheses that can be tested against empirical evidence, and then revise the theory if it proves inadequate to the case. In a metamethodological parallel, we can validate *metatheory* by working out its implications for the development of theory in the form of methodological inferences that can then be tested in the process of theorising. Just as we should should be prepared to revise theory that proves inadequate, we should be prepared to revise metatheory if *it* proves inadequate."

75-6:  summary of the five tests:

1. *the local complementarity test*---make a hypothesis as to the type of structural element a concept of interest represents, then validate this by working out the complementary structural elements implicit in this hypothesis; if any of the latter are empirically untenable, revise your initial hypothesis and try again;
2. *the downward recursion test*---when your hypothesis claims that a concept represents a type of entity identify the parts of this entity and ensure that these in turn are plausibly defined as entities, following the hierarchy of composition all the way down to a level that has a well-substantiated entity status;
3. *the retroduction test*---when your hypothesis claims that a concept represents a type of property, identify the mechanism responsible for the property and the parts and relations on which the mechanism depends; having done so, return to the first iteration technique;
4. *the emergence level test*---in addition, when your hypothesis suggests a property, validate the level at which the property emerges, by applying the criterion that a property is emergent at the level where the parts of the entity possessing it would not themselves have the property if they were not organised into this sort of whole; and
5. *the metatheory test*---when this method seems to lead to untenable conclusions, consider revising the method and perhaps the underlying general ontology.

81:  "it may be implied that social structure-as-relations can be causally effective. Yet relations alone cannot have causal powers; indeed a relation cannot exist at all in the absence of the things related. It is only when specific entities (and thus specific causal powers) enter into a relationship that causal consequence can follow."

81:  "Ultimately, then, the idea that structures have causal powers is incoherent if structure is taken to mean structures-as-relations and not structures-as-wholes."

82:  "we can only make sense of social structure by reinstating this sense of structure-as-whole and identifying the social *entities* that can possess causal powers. These are the entities that are *structured by* structure-as-relations, that *possess* the properties sometimes misleadingly identified as structures themselves and that *cause* those (partial) empirical regularities sometimes misidentified as structures."

82:  "The coherence of any bounded concept of society is extremely problematic. Those who use the concept often seem to assume that a society is co-terminous with the territory controlled by a particular state. States themselves may well control territory with well-defined spatial boundaries, at least in some respects. But they do not map neatly onto *societies*; there are many potential cross-cutting social systems that follow different boundaries, or none at all."

82:  "Given the lack of coherence of the concept of society, it is hard to see how such a poorly defined entity could have real causal powers."
