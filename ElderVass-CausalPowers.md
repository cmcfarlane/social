Introduction
---

1:  "Sociology is founded on the belief that our behaviour is causally influenced and in particular that there are *social* factors that influence our behaviour. […] Conventionally, the social factors that are held to influence our behaviour are known as *social structure*, a concept that even today remains implicit in, and indeed essential to, much of the work done in the social sciences."

2:  "Individualists about structure, it would seem, must be voluntarists about agency, while it is often believed that those who attribute causal significance to social structure must be determinists about agency."

4:  "Drawing on the theory of emergence, it argues that instead of ascribing causal significance to an abstract notion of social structure or a monolithic concept of society, we must recognise that it is specific groups of people that have social structural power. As I understand it, the social world is composed of many overlapping and intersecting groups, each of which has the causal power to influence human individuals. But in each case these powers depend on interactions between individual members of the group, and this argument thus depends in turn on the claim that human individuals themselves also possess causal powers---human agency. Social events, then, are produced by the interaction of *both* structural and agential causal power."

5:  "The value of the concept of emergence lies in its potential to explain how an entity can have a causal impact on the world in its own right: a causal impact that is not just the sum of the impacts its parts would have if they were not organised into this kind of whole. I shall call the capability of having such an impact a *causal power* of the entity concerned."

6:  "Emergent powers only exist when the parts concerned are organised into the type of whole that has these powers and hence they are powers of the whole and not of the parts. One implication of this argument is that explaining the *mechanism* behind a causal power does not explain away the power. On the contrary, it may help to justify our belief that it is causally significant."

7:  "there *are* social entities that possess causal powers, but that these entities are *not* whole societies. Instead, there are many different social entities, and indeed a number of different kinds of social entities, that possess social powers. What they have in common is that they are groups of people: people are their parts."

8:  "social events are also multiply determined and that in order to offer plausible explanations of them, we need to identify the multiple causal powers that are interacting to produce them, and indeed how those powers interact---how they interfere with each other or reinforce each other, for example."

16:  "For thinkers in this relational tradition, emergent properties are defined as properties or powers of a whole that are not possessed by its parts."

16:  "we must clarify what is meant by *wholes* and *parts*. Both wholes and parts in the basic definition above are *entities*, and the terms *whole* and *part* therefore describe roles played by particular entities in particular cases (an entity that is a whole in one context can be a part in another)."

17:  "an entity may be defined as *a persistent whole formed from a set of parts that is structured by the relations between these parts*."

17:  "A property is some intrinsic aspect of an entity that can have a causal impact on the world. I use *intrinsic* in order to exclude purely formal relations with other entities, such as 'larger than *x*', from definitions of properties. *Properties* and *powers* may therefore be regarded as synonyms."

17:  "Emergence occurs when a whole possesses one or more *emergent properties*. An emergent property is one that is not possessed by any of the parts individually and that would not be possessed by the full set of parts in the absence of a structuring set of relations between them."

17:  "Emergent properties may be contrasted with *resultant properties*---these are properties of a whole that *are* possessed by its parts in isolation, or in an unstructured aggregation." (e.g., mass of whole = mass of parts individually; averages of groups, such as height, age, weight)

19:  "In considering any individual entity, then, it may be useful to represent its structure as a number of layers, each being a successive decomposition of the whole into its parts (see the discussion of *lamination* in chapter 3)."

23:  "The relation between a whole and its parts is thus a relation of composition, and not of causation."

23:  "Nevertheless, we can often explain how the relation or interaction between the parts produces the overall effect. This process of interaction between the parts may be called the *mechanism* or *generative mechanism* that produces the emergent property concerned."

24:  Redescription principle: "the principle that *if* we explain a causal power in terms of (a) the parts of an entity *H*; plus (b) the relations between those parts that pertain only when they are organised into the form of an *H*; *then* because we have explained the power in terms of a combination---the parts and relations---that exists only when an *H* exists, we have not eliminated *H* from our explanation. The entities that are *H*'s parts would not have this causal power if they were not organised into an *H*, hence it is a causal power of *H* and not of the parts. The *lower-level* account of *H*'s powers merely *redescribes* the whole, which remains implicit in the explanation."

28:  "the structure acts *through* the person and the person *implements* the structure's causal power."

33:  "For an entity to have emergent properties, it must first of all exist, and the concepts of morphogenesis and morphostasis are used in explaining how this comes to be. All entities depend for their continued existence on the maintenance of their parts in the particular set of relations that is required to constitute the whole from them: on their *morphostasis*. We can express this by saying that each type of entity has its own characteristic set of *compositional consistency requirements*. […] Every different type of entity has a different set of such compositional consistency requirements and a corresponding structural range."

35:  "although it is clearly necessary for there to be a morphogenetic explanation of the coming into existence of any given higher-level entity, there is a sense in which it is the morphostatic explanations of its continuity of structure that provide the critical basis for emergence."

35:  "Some such morphostatic causes may be particularly strong: persistent entities are not just accidentally sustained but often arise from combinations of parts that have strong tendencies to cling together in a stable configuration. This makes the entities concerned highly resistant to destruction. Nevertheless, such resistance is always a causal achievement; it cannot be taken for granted as if there were some natural tendency to stability."

37:  "In general, morphogenesis encompasses processes that (a) contribute to the initial development or creation of any entity; and (b) contribute to the subsequent modification of its form within the structural range of the entity type."

39:  Five conditions an entity said to have emergent properties must meet: "(a) what are its parts?; (b) what are the relations between those parts that are characteristic of this particular type of entity?; (c) what set of morphogenetic causes has produced the entity in its current form?; (d) what set of morphostatic causes stabilises the entity and ensures its continued survival?; and (e) through what mechanisms do its parts and relations produce the specific properties of the entity?'

41:  Rejecting the idea of "covering law" deriving from Hume and Hempel. "The 'covering law' model of causality interprets such regularities as exceptionless *laws* that enable us to deduce what will occur whenever the preconditions for the law to operate are present."

41:  Hume speaks of constant conjunction (A goes with B, but it is impossible to say that A causes B); Hempel develops this view: "In this model, cause is again nothing more than the law-like (*nomological*) claim than an event of type A is always followed by an event of type B. Given that this is the case, he argues, we can *deduce* that when A occurs, B will follow, and the predict an event of type B."

46:  "the idea that there are *real but not actual* causal powers implies that it was always true that if an entity of a given type appeared it would have the powers that follow from its characteristic parts and structure."

46:  "the first appearance of an entity of a given type does not *create* the (real but not actual) causal powers of that type but merely instantiates them, just as subsequent appearances do."

47:  "mechanisms and powers do not generate exceptionless regularities; rather, they operate as *tendencies*."

47:  Multiple causation: "Outside the closed systems of the laboratory, multiple causal powers constantly interact with each other."

47:  "actual events are always the product of an unruly mess of interacting powers that happen to rub up against one another at that particular moment and place."

47:  "When an event takes the form of a change in a thing, this change may depend not only on the ability of the 'affecting' entity to have an impact, but also on a *liability* of the 'affected' entity to be affected in this particular way. Rocks, for example, have a liability to be eroded by wind and rain, whereas oceans do not. Liabilities, however, are simply a variant of emergent causal power---a power to change in certain ways in response to certain kinds of stimulus."

48:  "On the one hand, we must identify causal powers. We may need to observe partial empirical regularities---what Lawson calls *demi-regularities* or *demi-regs*---in order to be able to hypothesise these. This analysis of demi-regs allows us to theorize the existence of underlying causal mechanisms that are responsible, subject to circumstances, for the observable degree of regularity---a process that critical realists have labelled *retroduction*. On the other hand, to explain specific events, we must identify the set of causal powers that interacted to produce them and how they affected each other---a process that critical realists have labelled *retrodiction*. These two processes are complementary because the real causal powers identified by retroduction become building blocks in the retrodictive construction of explanations of actual events."

49:  "Now, for most purposes, when we discuss any given entity we are in the habit of ignoring the role of its parts. To treat an entity in this way is to take what I propose to call a *level abstracted* view of it---a view that considers the effects of the whole entity in isolation from the existence or effects of its parts. I argue, however, that for some purposes we sometimes need to treat a whole entity quite explicitly as a stratified ensemble of parts at various ontological levels. This is to take what I propose to call a *laminated* view of the entity."

53-4:  "To be a reductionist (or, to be more precise, an *eliminative reductionist*) about a causal claim is to argue that the claim is false because the real causal influences emanate not from the claimed source but from some lower-level source."

54:  "in an explanatory reduction, the higher-level claim is explained by showing how it arises from lower-level elements and the relations between them, but this is not taken to entail that the higher-level claim can be eliminated."

54:  "emergent causal powers cannot be eliminatively reduced"

55:  "A coherent reductionism must not only *dismiss* arguments for the causal effectiveness of higher levels, but also *establish* some for the causal effectiveness of lower levels."

55:  Any case that is made against emergence *in general* undermines the ontological basis of lower-level explanations just as much as that of higher-level explanations: these eliminative reductionists are merrily sawing off the branch upon which they sit."
