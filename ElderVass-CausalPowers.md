Introduction
---

1:  "Sociology is founded on the belief that our behaviour is causally influenced and in particular that there are *social* factors that influence our behaviour. [â€¦] Conventionally, the social factors that are held to influence our behaviour are known as *social structure*, a concept that even today remains implicit in, and indeed essential to, much of the work done in the social sciences."

2:  "Individualists about structure, it would seem, must be voluntarists about agency, while it is often believed that those who attribute causal significance to social structure must be determinists about agency."

4:  "Drawing on the theory of emergence, it argues that instead of ascribing causal significance to an abstract notion of social structure or a monolithic concept of society, we must recognise that it is specific groups of people that have social structural power. As I understand it, the social world is composed of many overlapping and intersecting groups, each of which has the causal power to influence human individuals. But in each case these powers depend on interactions between individual members of the group, and this argument thus depends in turn on the claim that human individuals themselves also possess causal powers---human agency. Social events, then, are produced by the interaction of *both* structural and agential causal power."

5:  "The value of the concept of emergence lies in its potential to explain how an entity can have a causal impact on the world in its own right: a causal impact that is not just the sum of the impacts its parts would have if they were not organised into this kind of whole. I shall call the capability of having such an impact a *causal power* of the entity concerned."

6:  "Emergent powers only exist when the parts concerned are organised into the type of whole that has these powers and hence they are powers of the whole and not of the parts. One implication of this argument is that explaining the *mechanism* behind a causal power does not explain away the power. On the contrary, it may help to justify our belief that it is causally significant."

7:  "there *are* social entities that possess causal powers, but that these entities are *not* whole societies. Instead, there are many different social entities, and indeed a number of different kinds of social entities, that possess social powers. What they have in common is that they are groups of people: people are their parts."

8:  "social events are also multiply determined and that in order to offer plausible explanations of them, we need to identify the multiple causal powers that are interacting to produce them, and indeed how those powers interact---how they interfere with each other or reinforce each other, for example."
