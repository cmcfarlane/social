Chapter 1: Introduction
---

3:  "the most tenable version of social realism is entirely consistent with the most tenable version of social constructionism"

4:  "If there is one claim that is definitive of social constructionism, it is the argument that the ways in which we collectively think and communicate about the world affect the way the world is."

5:  "There is no real dispute among social theorists about the fact that such communication [e.g., group coordination to accomplish a goal] affects subsequent physical acts, but social constructionists are interested in more challenging arguments."

5:  "Social constructionisms derive their from a further claim: that changing the ways in which people collectively think and/or communicate about the world *in itself* constitutes a change with significance for the social world."

5:  "one of the most significant implications of any claim that something is socially constructed is that it could be constructed *differently*: It would be possible for us collectively to think differently and this would make the constructions that depend on this thinking different in themselves."

6:  "what *exactly* it is that is being constructed, what it is that is doing the constructing, and what the process is through which this can occur."

6:  "Realists divide the world into that which depends on how we (individually or collectively) think about it and that which does not. For realists--and moderate constructionists--only the former can be socially constructed; the latter cannot. Radical constructionists tend to deny any such distinction on the grounds that *everything* depends on the ways in which we think about it, or at least to include in the socially constructed category things that realists would not."

7:  "social construction is both a real process and a process whose products are real: real, in both contexts, in just the sorts of way that critical realism would lead us to expect."

10:  "Perhaps the commonest constructionist answer to the question 'What is it that is doing the construction?" is *language*."

10:  "*linguistic arbitrariness*: the claim that language is arbitrary in the sense that it is not influenced by the world it is taken to describe."

10:  "*linguistic hegemony*: the claim that it is through language, rather than through perceptual experience, that our conception of the world is formed." Leads to the claim of anti-essentialism.

10:  "While our perceptions of the external world are influenced by our concepts, this is not a one-way but a two-way proces, one in which we collectively tend to develop concepts that are 'good to think with' because they tend to produce reliable ways to intervening in the world."

10-1:  "*the social determination of meaning*. This is the claim that the meanings that we associate with linguistic terms and structures are fixed, not by reference to the world, but as the outcome of social power battles."

11:  "leads to the conclusion that our conceptions of the world are determined by some sort of social power through the medium of language."

11:  other versions of social construction are possible, for instance those that prioritize *discourse* rather than *language* (as such).  "For Foucault, it is *discourse* that shapes the social world. The distinction between language and discourse is often missed, but it is an important one: *Language* provides us with the tools to express meaning and therefore shapes *how* we may do so, whereas *discourse*, at least as Foucault uses the term, relates to the regulation of the *content* of *what* we say."

Chapter 2: Norm Circles
---

Chapter is a summary of arguments more fully developed in *The Causal Powers of Social Structures* (Cambridge UP, 2010).

15:  "culture, language, discourse, and knowledge are all products of social structures. While there may be many different kinds of social structures, I argue that culture, language, discourse, and knowledge are all produced by different varieties of the same broad type of social structure. They are produced, to be more precise, by *norm circles*."

16:  Bhaskar's realism is premised upon a "causal powers" theory of causality; "causation is a product of the causal powers of things." Prefers the term "entity" to "thing" because wants to include material things as well as social things, hence "entities" seems to embrace these senses. But, note, entities differ from both "properties" (colour, size, quantity, etc) and "relations" (connections between entities). 

16:  "Causation, then, arises from the causal powers of entities. Actual events, however, are not caused by single causal powers, but instead are the result of interactions between multiple causal powers. They are, to use Bhaskar's term, *multiply determined* by a set of interacting causal powers."

16:  Because of multiple determination, empirical events are not flawless in terms of producing regular outcomes. Hence, causality "operate as tendencies." 

16:  Also rejects "positivist" accounts of causality such X is *always* followed by Y. 

17:  "the causal powers of entities arise from what [Bhaskar] calls *generative mechanisms*, or sometimes just *mechanisms*: processes in which the parts of the entity interact to produce its powers."

17:  "Mechanisms, in other words, depend on the composition and structure of the entities concerned. To be more precise, they depend upon (i) the set of parts; (ii) the powers of those parts; and (iii) the set of relations between these parts that are characteristic (and definitive) of entities of this type."

17:  "these powers are *emergent properties* of the things possessing them."

18:  "entities possess causal powers as a result of mechanisms that depend on their structure, and events are caused by interactions between multiple such causal powers."

18:  retroduction: "the activity of identifying single causal powers and explaining the mechanisms that produce them."

18-9:  retrodiction: "concerned not with a specific power but with a specific event, and seeks to identify the set of powers that interacted to cause the event concerned (or at least the most significant members of that set) and how they interacted with each other to cause it."

19:  "By combining both we avoid the kind of sterile structuralism that offers accounts of deep structures but is unable to relate them to real events, and we also avoid the kind of ad hoc empiricism (such as actor-network theory) that claims to explain events through the convergence of interacting influences but cannot justify the implicit claim that those influences are causally potent."

19:  "A regional ontology describes the complex of entities and powers at work in the events studied by a particular discipline or in a set of disciplines that studies a particular group of phenomena."

19:  "*social ontology*: an ontological analysis of the entities with causal powers that interact to produce social events."

20:  "most entities are composed of parts, which in turn are composed of smaller parts, and the explanations that we develop of the powers of the larger wholes must be consistent with our understandings of the powers of the parts."

20:  "*all* social entities are ultimately composed of material parts (primarily people) and that if we are to understand their causal powers we must ultimately demonstrate their rootedness in the material."

20:  "[Social entitites] depend on the beliefs and dispositions that individuals hold, and in particular on the commitments to each other that these entail."

20:  social ontology => social theory => empirical reality. Each "level" must be consistent with the others and if there is a contradiction or ill-fit between "levels," then something must give way--except, of course, empirical reality.

21:  "social entities are defined as *those entities whose parts include multiple human beings*."

21:  "First, when referring to my own ontology, I equate *social structures* to social entities with causal powers. Second, when referring to the sociological tradition more generally, I take *social structure* to be a rather vague term simply implying that there is some sort of social force with causal significance."

21:  Because social entities must include more than one human person, "social ontology must also be concerned with *human agency* and the mechanisms by which we, as material beings, contribute to and operate in a context that includes social structures as causal forces."

22:  "The theory of norm circles is intended to address the problem of normativity by identifying the type of social structure responsible for it."

22:  "A norm circle is a group of people who are committed to endorsing and enforcing a particular norm."

25:  "in addition to the proximal norm circle [the local norm-enforcers], each of us may also have an *imagined norm circle* for each norm--that set of people whom the central individual *believes* would endorse or enforce the norm."

25:  "there really is a determinate set of people who would tend to endorse and/or enforce this norm. We may call this the *actual norm circle* for the norm concerned. [â€¦] there will only be one actual norm circle for each norm, which includes all the (probably overlapping) proximal norm circles of all those individuals who hold the norm."

> Thus, three levels of the concept of norm circle: proximate, imagined, and actual.
	
26:  "a norm circle is an entity with the emergent causal power to increase the disposition of individuals to conform to the norm endorsed and enforced by the norm circle concerned."

28:  "It may be in practice that the norm circles for some norms overlap or cluster more or less completely with each other, in the sense that they all have much the same members. We may call these *norm-set circles*."

28:  "individuals may be influenced by a number of such clusters. To the extent that this is true, individuals become sites of *normative intersectionality*."

29:  "the differential influence of competing norms depends on the influence of power."

29:  "it does not rest on the assumption that those who observe and even endorse norms are personally committed to the rightness of those norms: They may do so for purely instrumental reasons."

29:  "multiple incompatible norms may compete for influence in any given social space at any given time, it is inherently open to cultural competition, conflict, and change."
