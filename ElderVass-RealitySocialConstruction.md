Chapter 1: Introduction

3:  "the most tenable version of social realism is entirely consistent with the most tenable version of social constructionism"

4:  "If there is one claim that is definitive of social constructionism, it is the argument that the ways in which we collectively think and communicate about the world affect the way the world is."

5:  "There is no real dispute among social theorists about the fact that such communication [e.g., group coordination to accomplish a goal] affects subsequent physical acts, but social constructionists are interested in more challenging arguments."

5:  "Social constructionisms derive their from a further claim: that changing the ways in which people collectively think and/or communicate about the world *in itself* constitutes a change with significance for the social world."

5:  "one of the most significant implications of any claim that something is socially constructed is that it could be constructed *differently*: It would be possible for us collectively to think differently and this would make the constructions that depend on this thinking different in themselves."

6:  "what *exactly* it is that is being constructed, what it is that is doing the constructing, and what the process is through which this can occur."

6:  "Realists divide the world into that which depends on how we (individually or collectively) think about it and that which does not. For realists--and moderate constructionists--only the former can be socially constructed; the latter cannot. Radical constructionists tend to deny any such distinction on the grounds that *everything* depends on the ways in which we think about it, or at least to include in the socially constructed category things that realists would not."

7:  "social construction is both a real process and a process whose products are real: real, in both contexts, in just the sorts of way that critical realism would lead us to expect."

10:  "Perhaps the commonest constructionist answer to the question 'What is it that is doing the construction?" is *language*."

10:  "*linguistic arbitrariness*: the claim that language is arbitrary in the sense that it is not influenced by the world it is taken to describe."

10:  "*linguistic hegemony*: the claim that it is through language, rather than through perceptual experience, that our conception of the world is formed." Leads to the claim of anti-essentialism.

10:  "While our perceptions of the external world are influenced by our concepts, this is not a one-way but a two-way proces, one in which we collectively tend to develop concepts that are 'good to think with' because they tend to produce reliable ways to intervening in the world."

10-1:  "*the social determination of meaning*. This is the claim that the meanings that we associate with linguistic terms and structures are fixed, not by reference to the world, but as the outcome of social power battles."

11:  "leads to the conclusion that our conceptions of the world are determined by some sort of social power through the medium of language."

11:  other versions of social construction are possible, for instance those that prioritize *discourse* rather than *language* (as such).  "For Foucault, it is *discourse* that shapes the social world. The distinction between language and discourse is often missed, but it is an important one: *Language* provides us with the tools to express meaning and therefore shapes *how* we may do so, whereas *discourse*, at least as Foucault uses the term, relates to the regulation of the *content* of *what* we say."
