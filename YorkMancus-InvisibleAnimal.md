76:  "the tendency of the theory [Lenski's ecological-evolutionary theory] to ignore the influence of animals on the evolution of societies and thereby render animals largely invisible in macrosociological research."

76:  "the general tendency of all sociological theories to neglect the connections between animals and society."

76:  anthrozoology "can add analytic power to sociological theory."

77:  "animals as an undifferentiated part of the biophysical backdrop makes them invisible, eliding the effects they have had on technological development."

77:  "Animals are of central importance to all human societies. […] As long as there have been people, their lives have been shaped by the diversity of animals around them. […] Animal domestication was one of the most important processes in human history. […] the domestication of animals represents one of the clearest illustrations of the interaction between humans and animals."

77:  "domestication was not singularly the product of human rationality, since it was deeply affected by the characteristics of the animals themselves."

86:  "macroanthrozoology, which will seek to understand the role animals have played in human societies generally."

86:  "a more comprehensive methodology could result from integrating anthrozoology and ethnobotany with sociological theory."

87:  "Animals have been practically invisible in sociological theory, despite the fact that they influence society in many ways."
