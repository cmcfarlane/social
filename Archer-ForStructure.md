465:  Defends *analytical* rather than *philosophical* dualism; King confuses these two terms assuming that there is a real distinction between structure and agency (philosophical dualism) rather than an analytical distinction between the two.

465:  "What makes analytical differentiation possible the two simple propositions: that structure necessarily pre-dates the actions which transform it and that structural elaboration necessarily post-dates these actions, which of course is precisely what practising sociologists want to examine in various fields."

465:  Not philosophical dualism because "(a) structures are only held to emerge from the activities of people, and because (b) structures only exert any effect when mediated through the activities of people." Hence, "Structures are ever relational emergents and never reified entities existing without social interaction."

466:  "we are indeed talking about structural properties and powers which defy reduction and are about causal influence which no re-description can eliminate from explanatory accounts."

468-9:  "realists not only know that the social world goes on but also that *how* it goes on is profoundly conditioned by the vested interests which a given structure has distributed prior to current action sequences."

469:  "Matters of ontology are not settled by interviewing people about them!"

470:  "to realists, knowledge about a state of affairs can never be taken *for* that state of affairs. To confuse our knowledge about reality with how relaity is means committing the 'epistemic fallacy'."
