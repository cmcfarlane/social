51:  Refers to two paradigms for social explanation: relationism (which is advocated) and co-determinism. This, in itself, is contentious. Moreover, co-determinism deemed to include: Archer, Bhaskar, Berger & Luckmann, Bourdieu, Giddens, Mills, and Mouzelis.

51:  "in one way or another, co-determinism explains social phenomena as the effects of inter-actions between agency and social structures."

51:  Prominence of co-determinism is explained on the basis of "general presuppositions," including "ideological presuppositions" (Alexander) "such as the paradoxical need for some individual freedom and a stable social order."

52:  "Relatively speaking, Archer's theory appears to be, at this point, one of the most sophisticated co-deterministic attempts to define the relationships between structure and agency."

52:  "social relations as the engine of production of social phenomena."

52:  "In other words, we would like to show that if co-determinism was a logical answer to the influence of deterministic theories such as structuralism, structural-functionalism, and structural-Marxism, it is time to shift from co-determinism to relationalism."

52:  "co-determistic theories explain the evolution of the social universe as the effect of inter-actions between social structures and agency."

55:  "modern thinking cannot easily accept determinism as a mode of perception of the social universe without, at the same time, killing the possibility of progress based on freedom and critical reflexivity."

56:  "Social theory should not correspond to cultural demands and some scientific habitus. It should reflect the reality of the social universe."

57:  "R. Bhaskar and M. Archer presume that fundamental characteristics of the social realm can be deduced from, or depend on, some philosophical/epistemological discussions."

59:  "The labels 'relationism,' 'relationalism,' or 'relational sociology' are used to identify theories that perceive social structures, if any, as effects of trans-actions between various social actors (actor <-> actor => social structure, if any). The social universe is seen as the effect of trans-actions between various and interdependent social actors."

59:  "the main challenge posed by relational theories is to explain social phenomena without *any* total or partial causal relation from social structures to action." 

60:  "No specific social actor can transform any social structure according to his/her free will, but no social actor is determined by any social structure."

60:  "denies the possibility of any empirical relationship between structures and social actors."

60:  "social structures, if any, refer to similar and continuous trans-actions, which can be seen from T^x to T^y in specific places."

60-4: Five principles of relational sociology:

1. Principle of Trans-Action
2. Principle of the "Primacy of Process"
3. Principle of Dereification
4. Principle of Relational Perspective
5. Principle of Emergency

60:  Principle of trans-action: "Specific social actions can be understood only as parts of a chain of trans-actions. In other words, any individual action is always one piece of a moving puzzle composed by interdependent actions: the action^A is the action^A only because it is interconnected to the action^B, and vice versa. […] Therefore, relationists study trans-actions rather than self-action or interaction."

60:  "In relational thinking, power is the effect of social relations; and 'properties' do not exist outside or prior to social relations."

60:  "A process of socialization results from empirical and complex trans-actions."

61:  "The notion of '*trans-action*' is different [from self-action, inter-action] since it denies that social actors and their actions can be understood as preexisting 'things' outside social relations. Social actors and actions are what they are, at some specific time and space, only through empirical chains of trans-actions. Besides basic and important biological properties, their properties are not intrinsic to their 'nature' or just individual. They constantly change in more or less significant ways through their trans-actions. In this sense, their properties are social not because they are determined by society, but because they occur through trans-actions. 'Individual' properties come from individuals and they are developed by them, but only by trans-acting with actors and other parts of their environment."

61:  "Real, empirical structures are real, empirical trans-actions."

61:  "rejects the use of any ontological or analytical distinction between structure (more or less continuous and similar trans-actions) and agency (social action)."

61:  "an analytical distinction between structure and agency implies an egocentric perspective of the social universe, which severely limits the potential of sociological imagination."

62:  Principle of 'primacy of process': "process-reduction happens when social processes are transformed into 'things,' and when individuals are separated from society as if they would be outside, beside, or prior to social relations."

62:  "sociologists should study interdependent actors and their relations instead of social things and isolated pre/post-'trans-acting' individuals."

62:  Principle of dereification: "get rid of any reifying concept, expression, and form of thinking."

62:  what are normally taken to be structures (state, class, etc) "do not act, think, enable, nor constrain since they are neither people nor social things."

62:  "the notion of agency cannot be seen as an individual 'property.'"

63:  "individuals 'transact' with other 'trans-actors' (individuals, weapons, and so on); and that sociologically speaking, individuals and other other 'trans-actors' take their properties through trans-actions."

63:  Principle of relational perspective: "replace the egocentric perspective for a relational perspective, which helps us to see what is occurring by studying trans-actions." Rathe underdeveloped as a point.

63:  Principle of emergency: "The quest for social laws is rejected by relational sociology because the evolution of trans-actions is undetermined and unpredictable."

64:  "The development of a relational sociology is an urgent task because we have the capacity to destroy ourselves in so many ways through our trans-actions (principle of emergency). Relational sociology is founded on the idea that the understanding of self-actions or of inter-actions between detached individuals ad social things did not and cannot help us to control our trans-actions. We can only hope that a better understanding of our trans-actions will help us improve our production of the social universe."

65:  "The notion of trans-action implies that the production of the world is not based on free will and self-action. The principle of trans-action is founded on the idea that the production of the social world happens through social relations and in a physical environment."

66:  "by adopting relationism, sociologists put themselves in a situation where their expertise on social relations might be more useful and refreshing."

67:  "sociology has a bright future if it succeeds in renewing the reflexivity of social actors."

67: "the best gift that sociologists can offer to other actors is a different mode of perception and thinking."

67:  "when agency is attached to detached actors, when agency is explained as an intrinsic individual property and comes from the adoption of an egocentric perspective, agency is reified."

68:  "Pure conceptual inventions and distinctions (structure/agency, micro/meso/macro, etc.) should not be seen as real things."

69:  "social structures are fixed only in our imagination or on paper. In reality, 'structures' are always in motion. In this respect, we are dealing with fluid social processes more than fixed social structures."
