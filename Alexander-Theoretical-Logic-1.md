Chapter One: Theoretical Logic in Scientific Thought
---

2:  "Science can be viewed as an intellectual process that occurs within the context of two distinctive environments, the empirical observational world and the non-empirical metaphysical one. Although scientific statements may be oriented more toward one of these environments that the other, they can never be determined exclusively by either alone."

5:  "At least since the end of the Second World War, there has been a growing tendency toward conceptualizing and practicing social science as a one-directional process, as an inquiry that moves, in terms of the framework I have presented, only along the dimension of specificity to generality. I will call this tendency the positivist 'persuasion' because in the context of contemporary sociology it represents much more of an amorphous self-consciousness than an articulate intellectual commitment"

5:  "The postulates central to the positivist persuasion are, first, that a radical break exists between empirical observations and nonempirical statements, and, second, that because of this break, more general intellectual issues--which are called 'philosophical' or 'metaphysical'--have no fundamental significance for the practice of an empirically oriented discipline. The third postulate, which completes what might be called the triadic foundations of the positivist orientation, is that since such an elimination of the nonempirical reference is taken to be the distinguishing feature of the natural science,s any true sociology must assume a 'scientific' self-consciousness."

7:  "The fourth and final postulate of the positivist persuasion continues and in a certain sense completes the intellectual thrust of the three principles that form its foundation. It posits that in a science from which 'philosophical' issues have been excluded and in which, correspondingly, empirical observation is thoroughly unproblematic, questions of a theoretical or general nature can correctly be dealt with only in relation to such empirical observation. [...] there has been a continual and relentless effort in sociological discussion to reduce every theoretical whole to the sum of its more empirical, more specific parts."

7:  "First, in regard to the *formulation* of social theories, the positivist persuasion argues that the process should be on of 'construction' through generalization, or induction, from observation."

8:  "Once theories have been formulated, however, there remains a second issue posed by this final positivist postulate, that of theoretical *conflict*. In an effort to transform theoretical into empirical argument, it is maintained that if sociology is to be an empirical science then, as Catton puts it, 'empirical test is the final arbiter in theoretical disputes.'"

8-9:  "The third aspect of the final, theoretically-directed postulate of the positivist persuasion follows ineluctably from the first two. If theoretical formulation and theoretical conflict can indeed be entirely reduced to the specific, empirical side of the scientific continuum, there can be no logical basis for any structured kinds of *scientific disagreement*, for what Rolf Klima has called the nonlinear 'horizontal' as opposed to the 'vertical,' progressive differentiation of scientific thought. According to the positivist persuasion, social scientific development is basically progressive, and differentiation is much more a product of specialization, more the result of focusing on different aspects of the empirical world, than of any more generalized, nonempirical disagreement over the same piece of observational evidence. The reciprocal character of this argument should also be apparent, for in the absence of structured scientific conflict, the necessity for any kind of more general scientific debate is further undermined."

9:  "Thus formulated by its leading protagonists, this positivist persuasion in contemporary sociology has had an impoverishing effect on the sociological imagination, in both its empirical and theoretical modes."

10:  "By making it more difficult for theoretical analysis to attain an adequate self-understanding, the positivist environment has ultimately limited the depth of theoretical perception."

15-6: "Human studies" as alternative to "positivist persuasion" challenges identification of sociology with natural science. "It is argued that because of the wide variation and relative inaccessibility of internal meanings--because, that is, of the 'nonempirical' or at least 'nonphysical' aspect of the subject matter of the human studies--the universal categories and objective arguments required for prediction and explanation are impossible to achieve. Furthermore, not only is the practice of social inquiry not completely independent of such nonempirical pursuits as philosophy and literature, but this social inquiry actually will more closely resemble philosophical and literary criticism than it will the sciences of nature."

16:  "At a minimum, it can be argued, as Dilthey did, that 'understanding' rather than 'explanation' should be the major goal of social inquiry, and that even those generalizations which are advanced will be of a fundamentally more tentative character than those in the natural sciences."

16:  "In its more extreme form, the idealist critique declares universality and objectivity to be completely illusory and limits all social study to the analysis of single, 'idiographic' events."

17:  "the question must then be asked whether natural science is itself related solely to empirical phenomena, whether in natural science itself there is not a 'generalized' subjective element in the very perception of data."

21:  "Committed to the epistemological distinction between the internal and external world and to the scientific ideal of universality, Polanyi conceives of scientific objectivity as emerging from the scientists' commitment to interpersonal formulations about the external world which aspire to universal validity. Insofar as the tacit, personal perception of the scientist 'submits to requirements acknowledged by itself as independent of itself,' Polanyi contends, 'it is not subjective.'"

21:  "we might expect that specifically 'philosophical' or 'humanistic' issues would have a bearing on the empirical propositions of the practical scientist."

25:  "in his original paradigm concept Kuhn erred by conflating the different levels of generality of the scientific continuum. Although he succeeded in pointing to their variety and their interrelationship, he failed to stress their relative autonomy. As a result, his treatment of the impact of paradigms on scientific practice obscures two vital points. In the first place, a given piece of scientific work is not affected by each of the 'paradigmatic elements' in the same way. In the second place, it appears for this reason highly likely that, contrary to the major thrust of Kuhn's argument, scientific positions can still share significant scientific commitments while sharply differing on certain others."

30:  "According to the representatives of the postpositivist persuasion, *all scientific development is a two-tiered process, propelled as much by theoretical as by empirical argument*. 

30:  "*All scientific data are theoretically informed*."

30:  "*Empirical commitments are not based solely on experimental evidence*."

31:  "*General theoretical elaboration is normally dogmatic and horizontal rather than skeptical and vertical*."

Note: this particular hypothesis maps on to Archer's discussion in *Realist Social Theory* on contradictions and complementarities.

32:  "*Fundamental shifts in scientific belief occur only when empirical changes are matched by the availability of alternative theoretical commitments*."

33:  "Theoretical confrontation is, therefore, just as significant a factor in creating shifts in scientific commitment as empirical confrontation."

33:  "If the nature of social science is to be properly understood, and its true potential fully achieved, the careful attention to methodological rules for induction from empirical observation must be matched by an effort to create a 'theoretical methodology' that can explain the opposing movement from more general principles."

34:  "social sciences, in which explicit argument over general principles is a very basic part of normal scientific development."

34:  "Social science institutionalizes what is for natural science an aberration"

Chapter Two: Theoretical Logic in Sociological Thought (1): The Failure of Contemporary Debate to Achieve Generality

36:  "only those thinkers who have thoroughly and explicitly broken from the positivist persuasion will even attempt an exercise in general theoretical logic."

37:  General presuppositions in theoretical logic "must be truly 'generalized,' principles so broad in scope that they cannot be subsumed by any more empirically-oriented level of the scientific continuum."

37:  "General presuppositions must, also, be truly 'decisive'' they must have significant repurcussions at every more specific level of sociological analysis."

37:  "Although the basic principles of differentiation and autonomy that govern each level of scientific thought ensure that theorists who agree at any level can, and usually will, disagree at other levels, the criteria of generality and decisiveness guarantee that insofar as presuppositional commitments are shared, certain clear and significant similarities will exist between arguments which may in every other repsect radically diverge."
