1:  "Cultural trauma occurs when members of a collectivity feel they have been subjected to a horrendous event that leaves indelible marks upon their group consciousness, marking the memories forever and changing their future identity in fundamental and irrevocable ways."

1:  "It is by constructing cultural traumas that social groups, national societies, and sometimes even entire civilizations not only cognitively identity the existence and source of human suffering but 'take on board' some significant responsibility for it. Insofar as they identify the cause of trauma, and thereby assume moral responsibility, members of collectivities define their solidary relationships in ways that, in principle, allow them to share the sufferings of others."

1:  "By the same token, social groups can, and often do, refuse to recognize the existence of others' trauma, and because of their failure they cannot achieve a moral stance. By denying the reality of others' suffering, people not only diffuse their own responsibility for the suffering but often project the responsibility for the own suffering on these others."

2:  "the sense of strangeness that allows us to think sociologically."

3:  "The enlightenment understanding [of lay trauma theory] suggests that trauma is a kind of rational response to abrupt change, whether at the individual or social level. The objects or events that trigger trauma are perceived clearly by actors, their responses are lucid, and the effects of these responses are problem solving and progressive."

7:  Quoting Caruth *Unclaimed Experience* (3): "Trauma is not locatable in the simple violent or original event in an individual's past, but rather in the way its very unassimilated nature--the way it was precisely not known in the first instance--returns to haunt the survivor later on."

7:  "The aim [of psychoanalytic lay theories] is to restore collective psychological health by lifting societal repression and restoring memory. To achieve this, social scientists stress the importance of finding--through public acts of commemoration, cultural representation, and public political struggle--some collective means for undoing repression and allowing the pent-up emotions of loss and mourning to be expressed."

8:  "First and foremost, we maintain that events do not, in and of themselves, create collective trauma. Events are not inherently traumatic. Trauma is a socially mediated attribution."

8:  "Sometimes, in fact, events that are deeply traumatizing may not actually have occurred at all; such imagined events, however, can be as traumatizing as events that have actually occurred."

9:  "Imagination informs trauma construction just as much when the reference is to something that has actually occurred as to something that has not. It is only through the imaginative process of representation that actors have the sense of experience."

10:  "Identity involves a cultural reference. Only if the patterned meanings of the collectivity are abruptly dislodged is traumatic status attributed to an event. It is the meanings that provide the sense of shock and fear, not the events themselves. Whether or not the structures of meaning are destabilized and shocked is not the result of an event but the effect of a sociocultural process. It is the result of an exercise of human agency, of the successful imposition of a new system of cultural classification. This cultural process is deeply affected by power structures and by the contingent skills of reflexive social agents."

10:  "For traumas to emerge at the level of the collectivity, social crises must become cultural crises."

11:  "The gap between event and representation can be conceived as the 'trauma process.'"

11:  "These group representations can be seen as 'claims' about the shape of social reality, its causes, and the responsibilities for action such causes imply. The cultural construction of trauma begins with such a claim."

11:  "Carrier groups [c.f., Weber] are the collective agents of the trauma process. Carrier groups have both ideal and material interests, they are situated in particular places in the social structure, and they have particular discursive talents for articulating their claims--for what might be called 'meaning making'--in the public sphere."

12:  Traumas are comparable to speech acts and have three elements: speaker (carrier group), audience (public), situation (environment of act).

12:  "The goal of the speaker is persuasively project the trauma claim to the audience-public." Speaking must be initially illocutionary in that the speaker must constitute to the traumatized group in speech. Success is indicated by members of the audience recognizing themselves as having been traumatized "by a singular event."

12:  "Representation of trauma depends on constructing a compelling framework of cultural classification."

13-15:  The "compelling framework" is compelling insofar as it successfully answers the following questions: "The nature of the pain," "The nature of the victim," "Relation of the trauma victim to the wider audience," and "Attribution of responsibility."

15:  "This representational process creates a new master narrative of social suffering."

15:  "In actual social practice, speech acts never unfold in an unmediated way. Linguistic action is powerfully mediated by the nature of the institutional areas and stratification hierarchies in which it occurs."

15-21:  Institutional arenas: religious (e.g., theodicy), aesthetic (e.g., survivor literature), legal (e.g., definitive judgment, responsibility, punishment, reparation), scientific (e.g., "evidentiary stipulations"), mass media (e.g., dramatization, journalistic neutrality, competition for audiences), and state bureaucracy (e.g., state power to "channel the representational process").

21:  "The constraints imposed by institutional arenas are mediated by the uneven distribution of material resources and the social networks that provide differential access to them."

22-3:  "As the heightened and powerfully affecting discourse of trauma disappears, the 'lessons' of the trauma become objectified in monuments, museums, and collections of historical artifacts. The new collective identity will be rooted in sacred places and structured in ritual routines."
