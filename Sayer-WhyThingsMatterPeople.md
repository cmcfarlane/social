Introduction: A Relation to the World of Concern
---

2:  "we are *beings whose relation to the world is one of concern*. Yet social science often ignores this relation and hence fails to acknowledge what is most important to people."

3:  "The aim of this book is to help social science do justice to this relation of concern, to lay normativity, and to the fact that we are sentient beings who can flourish or suffer. To do so we need to clear away a number of obstacles and develop more fruitful frameworks. One of the most important obstacles is the view that values are merely subjective or conventional, *beyond the scope of reason*---not susceptible to evidence or argument---and have nothing to do with the kind of beings that we are, or with what happens."

4:  "The view of values as beyond reason is part of a whole series of flawed conceptual distinctions that obstruct our understanding of the evaluative character of everyday life: distinctions such as fact and value, is and ought, reason and emotion, science and ethics, positive and normative, objective and subjective, body and mind, animal and human. Each term conceals internal distinctions that may be important, such as the different kinds of reason, and while the terms in the pairs are different they are not simply opposed and mutually exclusive, but sometimes overlapping, so that for example there is emotional reason. The distinction between is and ought, that has dominated thinking about values in social science, allows us to overlook the missing middle, the centrality of evaluation."

5:  "Concepts of human agency emphasize the capacity to do things, but our vulnerability is as important as our capacities; indeed the two sides are closely related, for vulnerability can prompt us to act or fail to act, and both can be risky."

6:  "It seems that becoming a social scientist involves learning to adopt this distanced relation to social life, perhaps so as to be more objective, as if we could become more objective by ignoring part of the object. It therefore often tends to produce bland accounts of social life, in which it is difficult to assess the *import* of things for people."

8:  "Although this ethical dimension of life matters enormously to us, social science is often poor at acknowledging and understanding it, preferring to account for action in terms of self-interest, or norm-following, or habitual action, or discursive constitution, which comprehensively fail to deal with the quality of ethical sensibilities."

11:  "values are often seen as private and inviolable---'my personal values'---and not to be assessed by others."

12:  "If I write 'people's judgements of what is good or bad depend on the social norms of their community' it may seem a broadly acceptable social scientific proposition. If I ask you, dear reader, if all *your* judgements of people and practices as good or bad depend simply on the social norms of your community, then you will probably say no. It is likely to seem not only wrong but offensive, for it suggests you merely believe what others have told you to believe. In other words, the third person, spectator mode tends to allow not only a distanced relationship to those under study but a demeaning one, because it leaves no room for the life of the mind, for personal decision and responsibility."

20:  "it is impossible to avoid at least an implicit conception of human nature in describing social phenomena, and having an unexamined, implicit conception is more risky than having an examined, explicit one."

20:  "I reject conventionalist accounts which tend to reduce morality or ethics to norms, and argue instead that our ethical sentiments are primarily related to our sense of harm and flourishing."

Chapter 2: Values Within Reason
---

23:  "social science's understanding of values is deficient, both with regard to their place in social life in general, and within its own methodology."

23:  "sometimes we have to evaluate behaviour or people in order to be able to understand and describe them adequately---both in everyday life and social science."

24:  "In social science, it is common to regard values in emotivist or subjectivist terms, as not being about anything, except perhaps the holder's emotional state of mind. They are also seen as conventional---as merely derived from social norms---rather than as valuations of circumstances and actions."

25:  "our descriptions of social life are likely to be inadequate if we attempt to avoid evaluation of social action and the conditions in which people live."

25-6:  "we should think of values as 'sedimented' valuations that have become attitudes or dispositions, which we come to regard as justified. They merge into emotional dispositions and inform the evaluations we make of particular things, as part of our conceptual and affective apparatus. They are more abstract than the particular concrete evaluations from which they derive and which they in turn influence. The relation between values and particular valuations is thus recursive."

26:  "Values differ from mere preferences or inclinations in that to some degree we have reflected upon them, though they tend not to be articulated unless challenged."

26-7:  "General evaluative stances towards familiar things may become habitual, but they are habits of thinking to which we become committed or emotionally attached. They inform not only how we evaluate others but how we evaluate ourselves, and they influence how we act, albeit often imperfectly. They therefore become part of our character, so that we are likely to feel upset if they are criticized; indeed radical challenges to them may feel like a violation. It is this quality which lends support to the view that values are subjective and private, indeed perhaps even sacred. However, they are not *just* subjective and private, and we do often contest them, not least because we are social beings and have to find a way of living with others, and because it is difficult to live with values that no-one else supports. Further, because values and valuations guide our actions, and our actions have consequences for our well-being and the things we care about, then judgements which lead to actions that worsen these are liable to make us rethink our values and valuations."

28:  "The treatment of values as subjective and private protects them from challenge in terms of their adequacy and consistency."

29:  "Consequently now, unless they happen to have studied moral and political philosophy, social scientists lack training in normative thought, and tend to be dismissive of it, regarding it as groundless and inferior, a threat to objectivity and unnecessary for understanding social life."

29-30:  "The divorce of positive and normative discourses reflects changes in society, particularly the rise of liberal individualism and the related rise of markets. According to liberalism, individuals should be free to decide on their conception of the good, and while this does not preclude public discussion of such matters, it prioritizes the right of individuals to pursue their own conceptions regardless of what others think, provided that they do not harm others. The spread of commerce increased the interaction between different communities with different values, and made it in their mutual interest to adopt a lowest common denominator form of consensus that allowed many differences to be left unresolved. One of the distinctive features of markets is that they do not generally require actors to *justify* their decisions and valuations; as long as buyers have money to buy the goods, that is all that matters. If you want to buy a sports utility vehicle (SUV) and have the money, you can have one: your money does the talking, not your reasons. Questions of the good are replaced by what will sell or can be afforded. So while capitalism has involved an explosion of rationalization, as Weber showed, it also liberates individuals not only from feudal bonds but from the need to provide reasoned justifications for many of their actions. Hence also the rise of 'subjective' theories of value, and the treatment of actors' values---including their valuations of and commitments to particular ways of life---as mere individual preferences, which is exactly how they appear in markets. Not surprisingly, with the development of capitalism and the extension of markets, the language of political economy has become less moralistic, so that instead of the rich moral economic vocabulary of 'self-interest', 'greed', 'envy', 'vanity', 'benevolence', 'pity', 'profligacy', 'prudence' and virtue, we have bland, vague and uninformative concepts such as 'interest' and 'utility'. Instead of studying how economic relations fit into the wider order of society and the ethical implications of such relations, political economy developed a narrow 'engineering' focus which unreflexively reproduced this capitalist 'de-valuation' of economic behaviour."

32:  "while much has been written on how values enter social scientific reasoning, little has been said about how values themselves involve a kind of reasoning."

36:  "A number of philosophers, neuroscientists and social scientists have proposed a broadly cognitivist view of emotions as a form of evaluative judgement of matters affecting or believed to affect our well-being and that of others and other things that we care about."

37:  "In addition to these dimensions of cognition and feeling or affect, emotions involve desire and concern to produce or prevent change; they incline us to act in some way, though we may override such inclinations."

37:  "Sometimes, we respond to things emotionally before we are able to articulate what has happened. […] To be emotional is therefore not necessarily to be irrational; in fact, in some situations absence of an emotional response can suggest a cognitive deficiency."

38:  "Emotions have complex normative structures that are responsive to particular kinds of social situations […]. Take the example of compassion. Nussbaum argues that it involves a certain kind of reasoning directed at someone's suffering. It includes the feeling 'or belief that the suffering is serious', a belief 'that the suffering was not caused primarily by the actor's own culpable actions … an that the pitier's own possibilities are similar to those of the sufferer'. Compassion also gives the compassionate a reason not merely for wanting to end the suffering of the dominated but to resent and nullify its causes. It can therefore lead to a social critique and not merely to individualist responses."

44:  "Social scientists may feel they should try to find more neutral or less value-laden words to describe such matters, but if they do, one of two things will happen: either they will mislead by euphemizing, as in the example of 'collateral damage' (in which case the description will be deficient descriptively as well as evaluatively---hence 'crypto-positive' as well as 'crypto-normative'), or the new words will come to take on a similar evaluative load to that of the old ones."

44:  "if we have just described what happens in a concentration camp, we do not need to add that it is bad."

44:  "it is not values as such that pose a problem for social science, but *dogmatically held* values."

45:  "refraining from using evaluative terms may weaken rather than strengthen the descriptive adequacy or truth status of our accounts."

47:  "Objective in the ontological sense relating to 'properties or characteristics of objects' therefore entails objectivity in the epistemological sense of the achievement of true or adequate understandings of the world is contingent (i.e., neither necessary nor impossible), and hence we must be fallibilists. Conversely, to be a fallibilist about knowledge is to presuppose the basic claim of realism, that many objects can exist independently of particular knowledges or claims about them."

50:  "In social science it is common to regard the naturalistic fallacy as providing a knock-down argument against the inclusion of evaluative judgements or 'values' in social research, though in philosophy there is also considerable---and weighty---criticism of the idea that one cannot make value-judgements on the basis of factual accounts, and of the assumption that the is--ought framework is even a helpful one."

53:  "*someone who did not know that suffering or humiliation were bad would not understand those phenomena*."

Chapter 3: Reason Beyond Rationality: Values and Practical Reason
---

61-2:  "Social theorists have mostly focused on one particular form of practical reason---instrumental, or means--end, rationality---in which, given a particular goal or end, we reason how to achieve it in the most effective and efficient way. But there are other forms of practical reason that are still important in modernity, and it is these that are my prime concern. They are concerned with ends rather than means, and particulars rather than universals. They are concrete and embedded rather than abstract and disembedded, they embrace ethical judgement, and they often take a tacit rather than discursive form, involving know-how rather than propositional knowledge. It also includes what is sometimes termed 'practical wisdom'. I certainly do not wish to invert the problem of rationalization by rejecting formal and instrumental rationality, but rather to acknowledge and defend the different but often complementary role of these other kinds of practical reason. Values, on this account, lie within the scope of reason thus defined, albeit a reason whose prime characteristic is not logic and consistency but *attentiveness to the object*."

64:  "There is also an interesting parallel here with the difference between rationality and wisdom, in which the former is associated with amoral cleverness, for example in solving given problems, and the latter with a more moral and second order or 'strong'' evaluation, in which we assess the goals or ends themselves, and the nature and significance of the problems posed. Note also that, while rational actors have some kind of logical procedure, we don't necessarily follow any particular procedure in acting reasonably or wisely."

65:  "we use 'reasonable' more often in describing people's actions and character with reference to other *people*, and 'rational' more often in describing their actions with respect to *things*."

66:  "whereas rationality implies precision and logical, rule-following action, reasonableness is inevitably imprecise, resistant to formalization and responsive to context and human capacities and frailties."

75:  "Experts can often quickly take in the whole situation before them and respond appropriately without thinking; seemingly at one with their instruments, they don't solve problems or make decisions, they just do what works."

76:  "It's interesting that when we are in a social situation where we lack a practical feel for the game, and are awkward and inept, not knowing what to say or do, we 'feel stupid'."

78-9:  "[Nomy] Arpaly reminds us that sometimes things 'just dawn on us'. Often we find the solution to some problem that has been bothering us not when we are thinking about it, but later when we are doing something quite different. Again, though this might seem an irrational process, in many cases it provides a rational answer to a problem. Moreover:

    Dawning processes are perhaps the main way in which people change their minds, especially concerning subjects they regard as important---the very subjects regarding which an attempt to argue with them and talk them out of the error of their ways is likely to encounter the sternest irrational resistance. Very few people who give up racist prejudices, for example, give them up in a process of deliberation. More often, the irrationality of their prejudice dawns on them after spending long enough with people of the relevant race and realizing, bit by bit, that they are very similar to themselves. (Arpaly, 2003, pp. 55--6)
    
"Even if we do come to see that something we have believed is wrong through encountering a convincing argument and decide that now we should act differently, this in itself is unlikely to be sufficient to change our ways of thinking and acting completely. For example, even if the white racist omes to renounce her racism on the basis of argument, she may still find herself unintentionally making racist assumptions in everyday life---assuming that the new doctor will be white, that a black child cannot be academically gifted, and so on. Having become consciously and sincerely anti-racist she may feel ashamed about the persistence of these unreformed reflexes, but it can take many years of repeated experience and practice to re-shape these completely. The process involves not just acknowledging errors of thought and action, but becoming a different person with different embodied habits of thought."

81:  "practical reason therefore often takes a practical form."

85:  "Insofar as social science is a theoretical enterprise rather than a practical one, it has less need of knowledge of particulars than do the actors who it studies; it also rarely needs to respond quickly to the irreversible flow of events, simply because the researcher is generally a spectator rather than a participant. Insofar as social research tends to focus on particular aspects of lives rather than whole lives, it is less likely to appreciate the need for practical judgement in the sense of evaluation of different ends that give shape to whole lives. Where it is primarily interested in common, general processes and objects, it tends to regard variation and difference as a nuisance, as 'noise', to be ignored or reduced by better choice of variables. All of these differences between the practice of social science and everyday life tend to lead to variants of the scholastic fallacy, in which social scientists focus on those aspects of everyday life that fit best with their own outlook, and therefore to devalue or ignore practical reason. Similarly the 'management' scientist's interest in finding successful general procedures can easily lead them to miss the value of practical reason and experience in organizational life. Successful practice depends on ability to deal with variety, as well as common features, and the former comes from experience."

87:  "the shortcomings of phronesis are not merely a matter of oversights, but *power*---and one that is hidden precisely because of the partly tacit nature of practical reason. While social science needs to take phronesis more seriously, both in the social practices it studies and in its own practice, it also needs to avoid idealizing it."
