510:  "a more straightforward definition of the conceptual relationship between agents and structures in terms of supervenience."

510:  "Giddens makes structures so vaporous that it is next to impossible to get a grip on them."

515:  "The problem, in essence, is this: on the one hand, some aspects of social structures seem irreducible to the conceptions, beliefs or deliberate actions of agents. On the other, no one wants social structures wandering around by themselves like so many lost cows." Prevent reduction of structures to rules while also avoiding essentialism/reification of structures into things.

516:  "[Archer's] claim is that our explanations will be unable to do justice to what we observe unless, for the sake of analysis, we think of societies and individuals as different things. [i.e., analytical dualism] This seems sensible. But, in addition to this, Archer also promotes a specific ontology, critical realism." As a result, for Archer, the first necessarily relies upon the second.

516:  "If we think of societies as abstract objects made up of relations that supervene on individuals, we can move towards a useful, non-reductive physicalism. This allows that social structures can have causal properties of their own, but makes it very clear what their relations to individual actors must be like."

516-7:  "To say that *A* supervenes on *B* is to say that there can be no differences in *A* without there being differences in *B*. This implies that when cases agree in subvening respects they agree in supervening respects."

518:  "Archer's attempt to get past the truism of 'no people, no society' by saying that 'people' includes dead people will not do."

519:  "we should think of social structures as sets of relations and relational properties which supervene on individuals and their actions. On this view, structures may well have relational properties that are independent of agents' intentions and conceptions."
