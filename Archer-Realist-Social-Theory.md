Archer, Margaret S. *Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach. Cambridge UP, 1995.
==

Second volume in a "trilogy" of works elucidating a general critical realist social theory. *Culture and Agency: The Place of Culture in Social Theory* (CUP, 1988) is the first volume and *Being Human: The Problem of Agency* (CUP, 2000) is the third volume. Since then has reconceived her project as providing the ontology for relational sociology's analytical framework. The book does valuable work in clearing away "methodological individualism" and "methodological collectivism" through a new articulation of the relation between structure/agency, but the account of the social is rather thing: only humans. 

Chapter 1: The Vexatious Fact of Society
--

1:  "Social reality" is distinct from "natural reality" insofar as social reality, unlike natural reality, is dependent upon humans for its constitution. Natural reality in comparison is self-subsistent. Social reality is also distinct from "transcendental reality" in that "divinity is both self-subsistent and unalterable at our behest." 

* natural reality: self-subsistent, but modifiable by humans
* social reality: dependent upon humans, modifiable by humans
* transcendental reality: self-subsistent, but not modifiable by humans

Hence, in Durkheimian terms, society is a reality *sui generis*. Social science must deal with "three unique characteristics" of society:

1.  "it is inseparable from its human components because the very existence of society depends in some way upon our activities."
2.  it is "characteristically transformable; it has no immutable form or even preferred state."
3.  "neither are we immutable as social agents, for what we are and what we do as social beings are also affected by the society in which we live and by our very efforts to transform it."

The relationship between individual and society "was *the* central sociological problem from the beginning." Or, in other terms, the connection between structure and agency. "society intrinsically is" the connection between structure and agency.

2:  "We *are* simultaneously free and constrained and we *also* have some awareness of it."

free/constrained "derives from the nature of social reality"; awareness derives from "human nature's reflexivity"

Social reality is neither determined by laws nor completely voluntarist.

"what society is held to be also affects how it is studied." As a result, a "social ontology" has implications for "the explanatory methodology." 

3: "tripartite link between ontology, methodology and practical social theory"

Downwards Conflation: "the 'solution' to the problem of structure and agency consists in rendering the latter epiphenomenal. Individuals are held to be 'indeterminate material' which is unilaterally moulded by society, whose holistic properties have complete monopoly over causation, and which therefore operate in a unilateral and downward manner." e.g., Comte, Durkheim

4: 

Upwards Conflation: "The solution to the problem of structure and agency is again epiphenomenal, but this time it is the social structure which is passive, a mere aggregate consequence of individual activities, which is incapable of acting back to influence individual people. Thus, people are held to monopolize causal power which therefore operates in a one-way, upwards direction." e.g., Mill, Weber

"I believe we should never be satisfied with these forms of conflationary theorizing"

5:  "The practical analyst of society needs to know not only *what social reality is*, but also *how to begin to explain it*, before addressing the particular problem under investigation. In short, methodology, broadly conceived of as an explanatory programme, is the necessary link between social ontology and practical theory."

Morphogenetic Approach: "The 'morpho' element is an acknowledgement that society has no pre-set form or preferred state: the 'genetic' part is a recognition that it takes its shape from, and is formed by, agents, originating from the intended and unintended consequences of their activities."

Presumably: agents refers to humans and activities refers to how humans act in relation to other humans.

6:  "In contradistinction, the *interplay and interconnection* of these properties and powers [roughly: structure/agency] from the central concern of non-conflationary theorizing, whose hallmark is the recognition that the two have to be related rather than conflated."

9:  "an emphasis upon the incidence of emergent properties which delineate different strata---an emphasis which does not assume observable differences in the size of groups automatically means that they constitute distinct levels of social reality [i.e., micro/macro, individual/collective]."

"Emergent properties are *relational*, arising out of combination (e.g. the division of labour from which high productivity emerges), where the latter is capable of reacting back on the former (e.g. producing monotonous work), has its own causal powers (e.g. the differential wealth of nations), which are causally irreducible to the powers of its components (individual workers). This signals the *stratified nature of social reality* where different strata possess different emergent properties and powers."

individual components of production=*individual workers*!? What about raw materials, ideas, machines, tools, etc?

10:  "the key points in this connection are that emergent strata constitute (a) the crucial entities in need of linking by explaining how their causal powers originate and operate, but (b) that such strata do not neatly map onto empirical units of any particular magnitude."

11:  "the crucial linkage to make and to maintain is not between the 'micro' and the 'macro', conceived of as the small and interpersonal in contrast to the large and impersonal, but rather between the 'social' and the 'systemic'. In other words systemic properties are always the ('macro') *context* confronted by ('micro') social interaction, whilst social activities between people ('micro') represent the *environment* in which the ('macro') features of systems are either reproduced or transformed."

Two implications. 

11:  First, the main theoretical task is linking two "*qualitatively* different aspects of society" (social/systemic, action/environment) rather than two "quantitatively *differently* features" (big/small, micro/macro). 

12:  Second, "if the misleading preoccupation with *size* is abandoned, then the linkages which need forging to account for the vexatious facts of society are those between the 'people' and the 'parts' of social reality."

14:  "social realism which accentuates the importance of emergent properties at the levels of both agency and structure, but considers these as proper to the strata in question and therefore *distinct* from each other and *irreducible* to one another, replaces the terms of the debate with entirely new ones. Irreducibility means that the different strata are *separable* by definition precisely because of the properties and powers which only belong to each of them and whose emergence from one another justifies their differentiation as strata at all. Three *differentia specifica* are denoted by the concept of emergence:
* Properties and powers of some strata are anterior to those of others precisely because the latter emerge from the former over time, for emergence takes time since it derives from interaction and its consequences which necessarily occur in time;
* Once emergence has taken place the powers and properties defining and distinguishing strata have relative autonom from on another;
* Such autonomous properties exert independent causal influences in their own right and it is the identification of these causal powers at work which validates their existence, for they may indeed by non-observables."

15:  "The 'people' in society and the 'parts' of society are not different aspects of the same thing but are radically different in kind. This being so, then social realism implies a methodology based upon analytical dualism, where explanation of why things social are so and not otherwise depends upon an account of how the properties and powers of the 'people' causally intertwine with those of the 'parts'. Analytical dualism means emphasizing linkages by unpacking what was referred to earlier as the 'impact' and 'import' of and between different strata. This focal concern with *interplay* is what distinguishes the emergentist from the non-emergentist whose preoccupation is with *interpenetration*."

15:  two basic propositions of morphogenetic/morphostatic approach: 

"(i) That structure necessarily pre-dates the action(s) leading to its reproduction or transformation;
(ii) That structural elaboration necessarily post-dates the action sequences which gave rise to it."

16:  "structural condition->social interaction->structural elaboration"

16:  "what *is held* to exist must influence considerations about how it should be explained. In other words, what social reality is deemed to consist of (and what is deemed non-existent) do affect how its explanation is approached."

What is held not to exist must likewise be the case. What doesn't exist for Archer?

First regulative function of a social ontology:

17:  "description and explanation are not discrete from one another [...]. What social reality is to *be* also *is* that which we seek to explain."

18:  "ontological concepts serve to define the explanandum [...]. Necessarily this circumscribes the explanans to such statements as could potentially explain social reality *as it has been defined* [...]."

19:  "the significance of concepts employed to *describe* reality also circumscribe those which can legitimately be entertained as *explaining* it."

Second regulative function of a social ontology:

20:  "Social ontologies [...] govern *those concepts which are deemed admissable* in explanation as in description."

21:  "Because the ontology contains judgements about the 'ultimate constituents' (and non-constituents) of social reality, it thus governs what sorts of concepts may properly be countenanced for any purpose whatsoever."

22:  "Ontology, I am arguing, acts as both gatekeeper and bouncer for methodology."

Third regulative function of a social ontology:

23:  "Since the nature of social reality, like any other for once, is a matter of fact which is independent of the prior commitments of any theorists about what exists, then if and when an incongruous method of explanation gives evidence of working, or the congruent methodological programme breaks down in practice, this should result in a reinspection of those commitments themselves. What we think social reality is cannot be a separate matter from what we find it to be."

Chapter 2: Individualism versus Collectivism: Querying the Terms of the Debate
--

34:  "The defects of Individualism and its explanatory programme derive directly from empiricism." In other words, individual refers to concrete things of sense-perception while groups does not refer to concrete things of sense-perception. Therefore, individualism. But this is false. Because "Perceptual sense-data secure the 'individual' only as a visible *organism*, yet it is precisely the non-observable things about people (their dispositions) which constitute the basis of the Individualist account."

39:  "I want to challenge this ontological claim to 'ultimate status' and its joint methodological implications, viz. that *in principle* all things social can be reduced to the individual whilst *in principle* such individuals are immune from further reduction to things psychological. Basically, the argument is that the postulated relations between the three areas represented by Psychologism, Individualism and Collectivism are inconsistent and cannot secure any kind of ultimate status for the Individualists' individual."
