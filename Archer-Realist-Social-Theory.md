Archer, Margaret S. *Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach. Cambridge UP, 1995.

Second volume in a "trilogy" of works elucidating a general critical realist social theory. *Culture and Agency: The Place of Culture in Social Theory* (CUP, 1988) is the first volume and *Being Human: The Problem of Agency* (CUP, 2000) is the third volume. Since then has reconceived her project as providing the ontology for relational sociology's analytical framework.

1:  "Social reality" is distinct from "natural reality" insofar as social reality, unlike natural reality, is dependent upon humans for its constitution. Natural reality in comparison is self-subsistent. Social reality is also distinct from "transcendental reality" in that "divinity is both self-subsistent and unalterable at our behest." 

* natural reality: self-subsistent, but modifiable by humans
* social reality: dependent upon humans, modifiable by humans
* transcendental reality: self-subsistent, but not modifiable by humans

Hence, in Durkheimian terms, society is a reality *sui generis*. Social science must deal with "three unique characteristics" of society:

1.  "it is inseparable from its human components because the very existence of society depends in some way upon our activities."
2.  it is "characteristically transformable; it has no immutable form or even preferred state."
3.  "neither are we immutable as social agents, for what we are and what we do as social beings are also affected by the society in which we live and by our very efforts to transform it."

The relationship between individual and society "was *the* central sociological problem from the beginning." Or, in other terms, the connection between structure and agency. "society intrinsically is" the connection between structure and agency.

2:  "We *are* simultaneously free and constrained and we *also* have some awareness of it."

free/constrained "derives from the nature of social reality"; awareness derives from "human nature's reflexivity"

Social reality is neither determined by laws nor completely voluntarist.

"what society is held to be also affects how it is studied." As a result, a "social ontology" has implications for "the explanatory methodology." 

3: "tripartite link between ontology, methodology and practical social theory"

Downwards Conflation: "the 'solution' to the problem of structure and agency consists in rendering the latter epiphenomenal. Individuals are held to be 'indeterminate material' which is unilaterally moulded by society, whose holistic properties have complete monopoly over causation, and which therefore operate in a unilateral and downward manner." e.g., Comte, Durkheim

4: 

Upwards Conflation: "The solution to the problem of structure and agency is again epiphenomenal, but this time it is the social structure which is passive, a mere aggregate consequence of individual activities, which is incapable of acting back to influence individual people. Thus, people are held to monopolize causal power which therefore operates in a one-way, upwards direction." e.g., Mill, Weber

"I believe we should never be satisfied with these forms of conflationary theorizing"

5:  "The practical analyst of society needs to know not only *what social reality is*, but also *how to begin to explain it*, before addressing the particular problem under investigation. In short, methodology, broadly conceived of as an explanatory programme, is the necessary link between social ontology and practical theory."

Morphogenetic Approach: "The 'morpho' element is an acknowledgement that society has no pre-set form or preferred state: the 'genetic' part is a recognition that it takes its shape from, and is formed by, agents, originating from the intended and unintended consequences of their activities."

Presumably: agents refers to humans and activities refers to how humans act in relation to other humans.

6:  "In contradistinction, the *interplay and interconnection* of these properties and powers [roughly: structure/agency] from the central concern of non-conflationary theorizing, whose hallmark is the recognition that the two have to be related rather than conflated."

9:  "an emphasis upon the incidence of emergent properties which delineate different strata---an emphasis which does not assume observable differences in the size of groups automatically means that they constitute distinct levels of social reality [i.e., micro/macro, individual/collective]."

"Emergent properties are *relational*, arising out of combination (e.g. the division of labour from which high productivity emerges), where the latter is capable of reacting back on the former (e.g. producing monotonous work), has its own causal powers (e.g. the differential wealth of nations), which are causally irreducible to the powers of its components (individual workers). This signals the *stratified nature of social reality* where different strata possess different emergent properties and powers."

individual components of production=*individual workers*!? What about raw materials, ideas, machines, tools, etc?

10:  "the key points in this connection are that emergent strata constitute (a) the crucial entities in need of linking by explaining how their causal powers originate and operate, but (b) that such strata do not neatly map onto empirical units of any particular magnitude."

11:  "the crucial linkage to make and to maintain is not between the 'micro' and the 'macro', conceived of as the small and interpersonal in contrast to the large and impersonal, but rather between the 'social' and the 'systemic'. In other words systemic properties are always the ('macro') *context* confronted by ('micro') social interaction, whilst social activities between people ('micro') represent the *environment* in which the ('macro') features of systems are either reproduced or transformed."

Two implications. 

11:  First, the main theoretical task is linking two "*qualitatively* different aspects of society" (social/systemic, action/environment) rather than two "quantitatively *differently* features" (big/small, micro/macro). 

12:  Second, "if the misleading preoccupation with *size* is abandoned, then the linkages which need forging to account for the vexatious facts of society are those between the 'people' and the 'parts' of social reality."

14:  "social realism which accentuates the importance of emergent properties at the levels of both agency and structure, but considers these as proper to the strata in question and therefore *distinct* from each other and *irreducible* to one another, replaces the terms of the debate with entirely new ones. Irreducibility means that the different strata are *separable* by definition precisely because of the properties and powers which only belong to each of them and whose emergence from one another justifies their differentiation as strata at all. Three *differentia specifica* are denoted by the concept of emergence:
* Properties and powers of some strata are anterior to those of others precisely because the latter emerge from the former over time, for emergence takes time since it derives from interaction and its consequences which necessarily occur in time;
* Once emergence has taken place the powers and properties defining and distinguishing strata have relative autonom from on another;
* Such autonomous properties exert independent causal influences in their own right and it is the identification of these causal powers at work which validates their existence, for they may indeed by non-observables."
