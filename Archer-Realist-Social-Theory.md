Archer, Margaret S. *Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach*. Cambridge UP, 1995.
==

Note: second volume in a "trilogy" of works elucidating a general critical realist social theory. *Culture and Agency: The Place of Culture in Social Theory* (CUP, 1988) is the first volume and *Being Human: The Problem of Agency* (CUP, 2000) is the third volume. Since then has reconceived her project as providing the ontology for relational sociology's analytical framework. The trilogy does valuable work in clearing away "methodological individualism" and "methodological collectivism" through a new articulation of the relation between structure/agency called "the morphogenetic approach," but the account of the social is rather thing: only humans. 

Note: the is a second trilogy that elaborates on these themes in the context of reflexivity as constitutive of the late modern experience: *Structure, Agency, and the Internal Conversation* (CUP, 2003), *Making Our Way Through the World: Human Reflexivity and Social Mobility* (CUP, 2007), and *The Reflexive Imperative in Late Modernity* (CUP, 2012).

Chapter 1: The Vexatious Fact of Society
--

1:  "Social reality" is distinct from "natural reality" insofar as social reality, unlike natural reality, is dependent upon humans for its constitution. Natural reality in comparison is self-subsistent. Social reality is also distinct from "transcendental reality" in that "divinity is both self-subsistent and unalterable at our behest." 

* natural reality: self-subsistent, but modifiable by humans
* social reality: dependent upon humans, modifiable by humans
* transcendental reality: self-subsistent, but not modifiable by humans

Hence, in Durkheimian terms, society is a reality *sui generis*. Social science must deal with "three unique characteristics" of society:

1.  "it is inseparable from its human components because the very existence of society depends in some way upon our activities."
2.  it is "characteristically transformable; it has no immutable form or even preferred state."
3.  "neither are we immutable as social agents, for what we are and what we do as social beings are also affected by the society in which we live and by our very efforts to transform it."

The relationship between individual and society "was *the* central sociological problem from the beginning." Or, in other terms, the connection between structure and agency. "society intrinsically is" the connection between structure and agency.

2:  "We *are* simultaneously free and constrained and we *also* have some awareness of it."

free/constrained "derives from the nature of social reality"; awareness derives from "human nature's reflexivity"

Social reality is neither determined by laws nor completely voluntarist.

"what society is held to be also affects how it is studied." As a result, a "social ontology" has implications for "the explanatory methodology." 

3: "tripartite link between ontology, methodology and practical social theory"

Downwards Conflation: "the 'solution' to the problem of structure and agency consists in rendering the latter epiphenomenal. Individuals are held to be 'indeterminate material' which is unilaterally moulded by society, whose holistic properties have complete monopoly over causation, and which therefore operate in a unilateral and downward manner." e.g., Comte, Durkheim

4: 

Upwards Conflation: "The solution to the problem of structure and agency is again epiphenomenal, but this time it is the social structure which is passive, a mere aggregate consequence of individual activities, which is incapable of acting back to influence individual people. Thus, people are held to monopolize causal power which therefore operates in a one-way, upwards direction." e.g., Mill, Weber

"I believe we should never be satisfied with these forms of conflationary theorizing"

5:  "The practical analyst of society needs to know not only *what social reality is*, but also *how to begin to explain it*, before addressing the particular problem under investigation. In short, methodology, broadly conceived of as an explanatory programme, is the necessary link between social ontology and practical theory."

Morphogenetic Approach: "The 'morpho' element is an acknowledgement that society has no pre-set form or preferred state: the 'genetic' part is a recognition that it takes its shape from, and is formed by, agents, originating from the intended and unintended consequences of their activities."

Presumably: agents refers to humans and activities refers to how humans act in relation to other humans.

6:  "In contradistinction, the *interplay and interconnection* of these properties and powers [roughly: structure/agency] from the central concern of non-conflationary theorizing, whose hallmark is the recognition that the two have to be related rather than conflated."

9:  "an emphasis upon the incidence of emergent properties which delineate different strata---an emphasis which does not assume observable differences in the size of groups automatically means that they constitute distinct levels of social reality [i.e., micro/macro, individual/collective]."

"Emergent properties are *relational*, arising out of combination (e.g. the division of labour from which high productivity emerges), where the latter is capable of reacting back on the former (e.g. producing monotonous work), has its own causal powers (e.g. the differential wealth of nations), which are causally irreducible to the powers of its components (individual workers). This signals the *stratified nature of social reality* where different strata possess different emergent properties and powers."

individual components of production=*individual workers*!? What about raw materials, ideas, machines, tools, etc?

10:  "the key points in this connection are that emergent strata constitute (a) the crucial entities in need of linking by explaining how their causal powers originate and operate, but (b) that such strata do not neatly map onto empirical units of any particular magnitude."

11:  "the crucial linkage to make and to maintain is not between the 'micro' and the 'macro', conceived of as the small and interpersonal in contrast to the large and impersonal, but rather between the 'social' and the 'systemic'. In other words systemic properties are always the ('macro') *context* confronted by ('micro') social interaction, whilst social activities between people ('micro') represent the *environment* in which the ('macro') features of systems are either reproduced or transformed."

Two implications. 

11:  First, the main theoretical task is linking two "*qualitatively* different aspects of society" (social/systemic, action/environment) rather than two "quantitatively *differently* features" (big/small, micro/macro). 

12:  Second, "if the misleading preoccupation with *size* is abandoned, then the linkages which need forging to account for the vexatious facts of society are those between the 'people' and the 'parts' of social reality."

14:  "social realism which accentuates the importance of emergent properties at the levels of both agency and structure, but considers these as proper to the strata in question and therefore *distinct* from each other and *irreducible* to one another, replaces the terms of the debate with entirely new ones. Irreducibility means that the different strata are *separable* by definition precisely because of the properties and powers which only belong to each of them and whose emergence from one another justifies their differentiation as strata at all. Three *differentia specifica* are denoted by the concept of emergence:
* Properties and powers of some strata are anterior to those of others precisely because the latter emerge from the former over time, for emergence takes time since it derives from interaction and its consequences which necessarily occur in time;
* Once emergence has taken place the powers and properties defining and distinguishing strata have relative autonom from on another;
* Such autonomous properties exert independent causal influences in their own right and it is the identification of these causal powers at work which validates their existence, for they may indeed by non-observables."

15:  "The 'people' in society and the 'parts' of society are not different aspects of the same thing but are radically different in kind. This being so, then social realism implies a methodology based upon analytical dualism, where explanation of why things social are so and not otherwise depends upon an account of how the properties and powers of the 'people' causally intertwine with those of the 'parts'. Analytical dualism means emphasizing linkages by unpacking what was referred to earlier as the 'impact' and 'import' of and between different strata. This focal concern with *interplay* is what distinguishes the emergentist from the non-emergentist whose preoccupation is with *interpenetration*."

15:  two basic propositions of morphogenetic/morphostatic approach: 

"(i) That structure necessarily pre-dates the action(s) leading to its reproduction or transformation;
(ii) That structural elaboration necessarily post-dates the action sequences which gave rise to it."

16:  "structural condition->social interaction->structural elaboration"

16:  "what *is held* to exist must influence considerations about how it should be explained. In other words, what social reality is deemed to consist of (and what is deemed non-existent) do affect how its explanation is approached."

What is held not to exist must likewise be the case. What doesn't exist for Archer?

First regulative function of a social ontology:

17:  "description and explanation are not discrete from one another [...]. What social reality is to *be* also *is* that which we seek to explain."

18:  "ontological concepts serve to define the explanandum [...]. Necessarily this circumscribes the explanans to such statements as could potentially explain social reality *as it has been defined* [...]."

19:  "the significance of concepts employed to *describe* reality also circumscribe those which can legitimately be entertained as *explaining* it."

Second regulative function of a social ontology:

20:  "Social ontologies [...] govern *those concepts which are deemed admissable* in explanation as in description."

21:  "Because the ontology contains judgements about the 'ultimate constituents' (and non-constituents) of social reality, it thus governs what sorts of concepts may properly be countenanced for any purpose whatsoever."

22:  "Ontology, I am arguing, acts as both gatekeeper and bouncer for methodology."

Third regulative function of a social ontology:

23:  "Since the nature of social reality, like any other for once, is a matter of fact which is independent of the prior commitments of any theorists about what exists, then if and when an incongruous method of explanation gives evidence of working, or the congruent methodological programme breaks down in practice, this should result in a reinspection of those commitments themselves. What we think social reality is cannot be a separate matter from what we find it to be."

Chapter 2: Individualism versus Collectivism: Querying the Terms of the Debate
--

34:  "The defects of Individualism and its explanatory programme derive directly from empiricism." In other words, individual refers to concrete things of sense-perception while groups does not refer to concrete things of sense-perception. Therefore, individualism. But this is false. Because "Perceptual sense-data secure the 'individual' only as a visible *organism*, yet it is precisely the non-observable things about people (their dispositions) which constitute the basis of the Individualist account."

39:  "I want to challenge this ontological claim to 'ultimate status' and its joint methodological implications, viz. that *in principle* all things social can be reduced to the individual whilst *in principle* such individuals are immune from further reduction to things psychological. Basically, the argument is that the postulated relations between the three areas represented by Psychologism, Individualism and Collectivism are inconsistent and cannot secure any kind of ultimate status for the Individualists' individual."

42:  How Individualists provide an account of structure: "That Individualists remain undaunted is due to their empiricism itself which reassures them that, however complex, there are only two possible ways in which it can be construed: either social organization is constituted by things which are manifestly real or by reified entities, and of the two the former must be correct." Thus, they must show that the manifestly real things are "other people." 

42-3:  To demonstrate this claim ("an *ontological assertion*"), it must be demonstrated. Individualists must show that "*social structure is not*: (i) autonomous or independent, (ii) pre-existent, (iii) causally efficacious." It has been argued persuasively by Collectivists that they all on three.

First count---autonomy:

43:  "If autonomy is to be withheld from the social context and it is be denied any independence from people, this that the Individualist must vindicate the claim that it can be treated as nothing other than an *aggregate* of individuals, which as such has no independence from its constituents---therefore our social environment is constituted by 'interpersonal relations'. It follows that if the 'social structure' is only an aggregate, then 'the group' becomes synonymous with 'the social' to the Individualist."

This can be defeated in two ways. First, speaking of kinship systems, we are comparing different sets of rules and not different sets of activities which may or may not be in conformity with those rules. Adherence to the rule (or not) does not make or unmake the rule. Thus, the group (=aggregate individuals) and the rule (=structure) can be distinguished. Likewise, in stereotypical situations (student/teacher, tenant/landlord, customer/banker) the roles performed by each are more important to the explanation than any particular details about the individuals involved in the relation. Indeed, "in social analysis we often are and have to be less concerned with interpersonal relations that with the endurance of *im*personal role relationships."

Second count---pre-existence:

43-4:  "Thus, the social context has become the effect of *contemporary* other people. For it follows that whatever makes up our environment (such as enduring roles, positions and distributions) are all things that the 'people concerned' now do not want to change/do not know how to change or do not think about changing. In other words, whatever the origins of the social tendencies and features we observe, their present existence is due in some way to the people present. Therefore, explanation of the social structure is always in the present tense and responsibility for everything present lies firmly on the shoulders of those here present."

However, pre-existence of the social context (i.e., prior to the present) is a fact. The language of the society pre-exists any individual speaker/member and this acts as a constraint/enabler. The same applies to social relations (tenant/landlord) that have developed over time through a series of repeated interactions. This isn't limited to things such as language and social roles. Even demographic features work this way in that they can be described as an aggregate of individuals and even if all those individuals agreed to change an aspect of the aggregate (birth rate), this present decision would only be actualized over time through either a changed birth rate (or not). 

Third count---causal efficacy:

44-5:  "Denial of the pre-existence of social forms was intended to deprive them of any causal efficacy, yet this claim also fails if such properties are resistant to change or take a considerable time to alter. Although many of them may *eventually* be changed by human action, nevertheless *while* such environmental factors endure, they can constrain and facilitate different activities and may have consequences which are not trivial for future social change. The Individualists, however, make the opposite assumption. In effect, they argue that because such social tendencies are ultimately reversible, nothing or importance will happen *before* they are reversed. Matters of this kind cannot be decided by theoretical *fiat*."

[End criticism of Individualism]

46:  "The irony of Collectivism is that whilst it defends the methodological indispensability of 'structural factors', no overall conception of social structure is advanced ontologically." Because they "were simultaneously haunted by Holism and hamstrung by Empiricism." For fear of reifying structure, they failed to theorize structure ontologically. The outcome is that they take "social context" into account only because explaining in terms of individuals isn't sufficient. 

48:  "The first cause of unease is the doubt that any referent of a holistic concept can have an affect upon concrete individuals, since this seems to endow an abstraction with some kind of existence which cannot be flesh and blood and therefore must entail a different substance (from people) if it is real." Thus, either structure must be some sort of 'substance' or structure is not real. 

48:  "The second source of concern derived from the current (and continuing) mis-assumption that to consider 'societal facts' as being *sui generis* entailed reification because it implied that they were generated by society itself---as a separate and superordinate entity, 'Society'." The cause of this error, says Archer, is that they were just really bad at Latin and misunderstand the meaning of the term *sui generis*.

49:  "methodology should indeed regulate ontology"

51:  "to talk about 'emergent powers' is simply to refer to a property which comes into being through social combination. These are literally 'existential emergents'. They exist by virtue of inter-relations, although not all relationships give rise to them. Thus, the increased productivity of Adam Smith's pin-makers was a power emergent from their division of labour (relations of production) and not reducible to personal qualities like increased dexterity."

52:  "The existence of such causal powers has nothing to do with essentialism for as the entity changes (through natural causes such as metal fatigue or social causes such as a Third World embargo on multinational imports), so the powers change because their internal relations have altered (or been altered) in ways which nullify that which was necessary to the power in question."

53:  "emergent properties rarely produce constant conjunctions in society and therefore almos always fail to establish a claim to reality on the empiricist criterion of causality."

[End criticism of Collectivism]

57:  "Individualists began from an unshakable *ontological commitment* that the ultimate constituents of social reality were 'individuals', formulated their methodological injunction on this basis, yet were unwilling to make ontological adjustments in light of the unworkability of their own methods and the findings of others who did not share their commitment to the necessity of reductionism. By contrast, Collectivists started from an equally strong *methodological conviction* that facts about the social context could neither be excised from the description or explanation or our subject-matter, but failed to ground this in a conception of social reality which both avoided any taint of Holism and evaded the strictures of empiricism."

60:  Two new "*standpoints*" developed in the 1970s/1980s in relation to the structure/agency debate. 

1. Elisionism: "transcending the dualism between individual and society consisted in replacing it by an insistence upon their mutual constitution."
2. Emergentism: "structure and agency are both regarded as emergent strata of social reality and linkage consists in examining their interplay."

60:  Elisionism beginning with symbolic interactionists, taken on an idealist version. "(i) a denial of their separability, because (ii) every aspect of 'structure' is held to be activity-dependent in the present tense and equally open to transformation, and (iii) the conviction that any causal efficacy of structure is dependent upon its evocation by agency."

60:  Structuration: "incorporates material resources and power rather than dealing with networks of meanings alone"

60: In comparison, the idea of emergent properties is incompatible with Elisionism (i.e., inseparability) "because such structural and cultural features have autonomy from, are pre-existent to, and are causally efficacious *vis-à-vis* agents---their existence, influence and analysis therefore being incompatible with the central premises of Elisionism."

61:  If Individualism is reductionist and Collectivism is antireductionist, Elisionism is areductionist because structure/agency (1) are inseparable and (2) co-constitutive. As a result, the relation is not epiphenomenal. This results in a new fallacy, a counterpart to upwards/downwards conflation: "central conflation."

61:  Realism endorses (1) "the existence of irreducible 'emergent properties'", (2) "a much robustly *stratified* view of both society and people" and (3) "resist central conflation."

62:  Analytical dualism: "the social world is made up, *inter alia*, of 'structures' and of 'agents' and because these belong to different strata, there is no question of reducing one to the other or of eliding the two and there is every reason for exploring the interplay between them."

Chapter 3: Taking Time to Link Structure and Agency
-

65:  "a theoretical approach which is capable of *linking* structure and agency rather than *sinking* one into the other. The central argument is that structure and agency can only be linked by examining the *interplay between them over time*, and that without the proper incorporation of time the problem of structure and agency can never be satisfactorily resolved."

66:  "each possesses autonomous emergent properties which are thus capable of independent variation and therefore of being out of phase with one another in time."

67:  Analytical dualism: "Firstly, it depends upon an ontological view of the social world as stratified, such that the emergent properties of structures and agents are irreducible to one another, meaning that in principle they are analytically separable. Secondly, it asserts that given structures and agents are also temporally distinguishable (in other words, it is justifiable and feasible to talk of pre-existence and posteriority when dealing with specific instances of the two), and this can be used methodologically in order to examine the interplay between them and thus explain changes in both---over time. In a nutshell, 'analytical dualism' is a methodology based upon the *historicity of emergence*."

70:  Society is an essential open system. Why is it not closed? "Closure depends upon two conditions, an intrinsic and an extrinsic one, both of which are ineluctably violated by what people are."

1.  Extrinsic: "requires that no new emergent properties are developing *outside* the system, which can interfere with the exercise of its known emergent powers in unpredictably ways. Yet whatever social structures are examined, they are only operative in and through the world of people which props the door permanently open because human action is typified by innovativeness, a capacity for interpreting the same material conditions, cultural elements, circumstances and situations in different ways and hence for introducing novel patterns or courses of action in response to them." This feature ("innovativeness") can't be controlled for and makes closure impossible.

2.  Intrinsic: "there must be no change or qualitative variation (like the effects of impurities in chemistry experiments) in the entity possessing the causal powers if the mechanism is to operate consistently and produce regular results. Closure thus implies that no new properties can develop *inside* the system or structure in question, which change it and alter its effects."

70:  "any social structure is dependent upon people and operative only through people"

70:  While society is an open system characterized by emergence, this presents some obvious difficulties for ontology, methodology, and theory. It is thus necessary to clearly distinguish the properties of structures from the properties of people: i.e., analytical dualism must be possible. "In brief it is *necessary* to separate structure and agency (a) to identify the emergent structure(s), (b) to differentiate between their causal powers and the intervening influences of people due to their quite different causal powers as human beings, and, (c) to explain any outcome at all, which in an open system always entails an interplay between the two. In short, separability is indispensable to realism."

71:  The analytical separation between structure and agency is necessary, but not sufficient for a realist theory. A temporal distinction between the two is equally necessary. Structure and agency are out of phase with one another. "Structures (as emergent entities) are not only irreducible to people, they pre-exist them, and people are not puppets of structures because they have their own emergent properties which mean they either reproduce or transform social structure, rather than creating it."

75:  "agents and individuals cannot be used interchangeably"

75:  "to state that some structures are pre-existent to determinate agents and activities has no ontological priority over emphasizing that the self-same agents are themselves prior to later structural elaboration."

78:  "Determinism is not built in to the morphogenetic perspective."

79:  "Voluntarism has an important place in morphogenesis but is ever trammelled by past structural and cultural constraints."

79-80:  "In brief, the Fallacy of Conflation always entails a failure to incorporate temporality into social theory properly. This it seems is a logical consequence of conflation itself."

80:  "In both the 'upwards' and 'downwards' versions, the fundamental drawback is that by making agency *dependent* upon structure, or vice versa, they automatically preclude any two-way interplay between the levels---because in each, one level is rendered inert [i.e., an epiphenomenon of the other]. Consequently, the dependent element is robbed of the capacity to exploit or to influence the determining element, for it lacks the autonomy and independence to do so. This then blocks an adequate conceptualization of the processes explaining social stability and change. Instead, adherents of both approaches advance rather crude unilateral accounts, which have equal but opposite defects. In the one, structural properties are simply pushed around by some untrammelled dominant group or placed at the mercy of capricious renegotiation by unconstrained agency. In the other, social structure imposes its choreography on interaction and agents are reduced to *träger* or bearers of its properties, whether through oversocialization or mystification."

[Convincing attack on downwards, upwards, and central conflationism in terms of time, but the outline of the attack on each can be derived from the passage on page 80 already quoted.]

90:  "In *structural conditioning*, systemic properties are viewed as the emergent or aggregate consequences of past actions. Once they have been elaborated over time they are held to exert a causal influence upon subsequent interaction. Fundamentally, they do so by shaping the situations in which later 'generations' of actors find themselves and by endowing various agents with different vested interests according to the positions they occupy in the structures they 'inherit' [...] In short, when we talk about structural properties and their effects from the morphogenetic perspective, we are also endorsing the realist notion of emergence and its causal powers."

90-1:  "However, *social interaction* is seen as being structurally conditioned but never as structurally determined (since agents possess their own irreducible emergent powers). On the one hand, the mediatory mechanism which transmits structural influences to human actors consists in the former moulding frustration or rewarding contexts for different groups of agents, depending upon the social positions the occupy. In turn, it is argued that these experiences of frustrations or benefits conditions different situational interpretations and dissimilar action patterns: groups experiencing exigencies seek to eradicate them (thus pursuing structural change) and those experiencing rewards try to retain them (thus defending structural stability). Regularities of this kind, detectable in subsequent patterns of interaction, are reflections of these objective opportunity costs. None the less their effect is only conditional: they force no one, but simply set a price on acting against one's self-declared interests and a premium on following them (consequently detectable regularities do not even approximate to constant conjunctures). To acknowledge this involves nothing more sinister than the Weberian assumption that most of the time for most people there is a rough congruence between their interests, interpretations and actions. On the other hand, since conditioning is not determinism, the middle element of the cycle also recognizes the promotive creativity of interest groups and incorporates their capacity for innovative responses in the face of contextual constraints. Equally, it accommodates the possibility of reflective self-sacrifice of inherited vested interests on the part of individuals or groups."

91:  "The *structural elaboration* which then ensues is interpreted as being a largely unintended consequence. The modification of previous structural properties and the introduction of new ones is the combined product of the different outcomes pursued simultaneously by various social groups. The unintended element largely results from group conflict and concession which together mean that the consequential elaboration is often what no-one sought or wanted. [...] The end point and the whole point of examining any particular cycle is that we will then have provided an analytical *history* of emergence of the problematic properties under investigation."

91:  "Thus every morphogenetic cycle distinguishes three broad analytical phases consisting of (a) a given structure (a complex set of relations between parts), which conditions but does *not* determine (b), social interaction. Here, (b) also arises in part from action orientations unconditioned by social organization but emanating from current agents, and in turn leads to (c), structural elaboration or modification---that is, to a change in the relations between parts where morphogenesis rather than morphostasis ensued."

91:  "Advocates of the morphogenetic perspective do not deny that social interaction is the ultimate source of complex phenomena (which include both unintended aggregate and emergent consequences)"

Chapter 4: Elision and Central Conflation
-

94:  Why does Giddens find virtue in the inseparability/structuration thesis? "Basically the answer lies in what he hopes to wrest social theory away from---the reified notion (in his view) of emergent properties, as prior to and autonomous from action and the reductionist conception (in his view) of individuals, with personal properties which are independent and detachable from the social context of their formation and expression. The proposal is that all of this can be transcended by substituting a social ontology of praxis."

94-5: How does concept of social practices resolve/deal with issues of social complexity? Flatten the depth of the social world by denying existence to emergent properties. As a result, distinction between micro- and macro- is denied in favour of face-to-face interaction and distanced interaction. These are seen as qualitatively different. 

95:  In face-to-face interaction, individuals draw upon structural properties (=rules/resources) and recreate these structural properties through their use. The outcome is that the entirety of social structure is used in any and all social interactions regardless of how small. While Giddens argues that the entire structure is "involved" in every social act, he denies that the structure is determinate in the social act.

95:  Social practices are also the foundations of institutions, which are "nothing more than regularized practices, structured by rules and resources. When 'structural properties' are drawn upon in a routinized fashion, an institution becomes 'sedimented' as a clustering of the practices constituting it. In turn this means that 'institutions' are never something concrete to which we can point but are essentially processual; ever in a fluid process of becoming and never in a (temporal or temporary) fixed state of being, because all structural properties and all actions are always potentially transformational."

96:  "At the largest scale of interaction, the social system (defined by him as the visible pattern generated from agents transforming the modalities of structural properties to produce this patterning), Giddens is still not dealing with anything separable from action. The only difference is that, at the systematic level, he is dealing with relations between 'groups and collectivities' rather than individual actors. Thus there is complete continuity, for here too 'the integration of social systems is something which is constantly reproduced by the action of agents', through their social practices---there are simply more of both."

96:  "the system merely refers to relations between larger numbers occurring at a distance"

97-8:  "Because 'structure' is inseparable from 'agency' then, *there is no sense in which it can be either emergent or autonomous or pre-existent or causally influential*. Instead, 'structural properties' (i.e., defined as 'rules and resources') are 'instantiated' in social practices and have no existence outside this instantiation by agency. In this consistent ontology of praxis, structural properties exist and have any efficacy only by courtesy of agents. Without 'instantiation', they have only a 'virtual existence' as 'material' entities; materials belonging to the physical rather than the social world (land, resources, or printed paper labelled, for instance, the Highway Code)."

98:  "if 'structural properties' really only exist when instantiated in social practices, where, apart from their 'material existents' do they actually have their existence?" Structures can only exist "as memory traces which are transmitted from one set of agents to others", "in the heads of social actors" (Craib), "internal to actors" (Kilminster).

105:  To be successful, the Elisionist account of structure must (1) break with all preceding notions of structure [i.e., individualist/collectivist, as well as emergentist] and (2) do so without any remainder that is not captured by the concept of social practices.

105-6:  Methodological Individualist definition of structure: "patterns of aggregate behaviour that are stable over time." Rejected for four reasons: (1) atomism; (2) that structuration is nothing but a matter of aggregation; (3) equating the pattern with structure; and (4) that structures are enduring.

106:  Methodological Holism definition of structure: "lawlike regularities that govern the behaviour of social facts." Rejected for for four reasons: (1) reification of structure through disconnecting it from action; (2) assumption that regularities are lawlike in their production of consequences; (3) that these lawlike regularities are deterministic; and (4) that these structures endure over time and have an ontological status comparable to natural laws.

106:  Methodological Realist definition of structure: "systems of human relations among social positions." Rejected for three reasons: (1) structures refer to real entities with their own powers; (2) social interaction is independent from social structure; (3) structure pre-exists social action and thus acts as a constraining force.

107:  The structuration concept of structure needs to do three things:

1. "shifts the referent of 'structure' away from identifiable forms of social organization (the division of labour, educational systems, political parties ...) and links them instead to underlying organizing principles, which generate what they do only because agents draw upon them in particular ways in the course of the social practices in which they engage."

2. "when it is objected that even here things like educational systems still figure in Elisionist theory, it is quickly countered that this visible pattern has no independent existence or influence but is only an abstraction from the repertoire of repetitive or routinized practices surrounding education. Institutions themselves are thus reconstrued as 'regularized practices', whose very regularity (i.e., endurance) depends upon agency invoking the same structural principles in the same way because praxis has become routinized."

3. "one of the most obvious difficulties in these re-definitional manoeuvres is that the very 'rules and resources' which are drawn upon to generate social practices could therefore be held to be something other than (i.e., autonomous, external, anterior to) social practices. Here, the defence consists in placing 'rules and resources' outside time and space and endowing them with only a 'virtual existence' until or unless 'instantiated' by agents in the course of social praxis."

117:  "the terms 'agent', 'actor' and 'person' are used interchangeably within structuration theory."

117-8:  "What is questioned first are the basic Elisionist equations; agency=action, action=an ability to do otherwise, and therefore, agents=those who could have done otherwise. This I maintain produces the 'over active agent' and the crucial remainder which is omitted is agents' capacity 'to make a difference' *simply through their existence as members of collectivities with particular properties*, which no amount of activity on their part can make other than that they are at any given time."

119:  "What I have in mind here are collectivities whose very *presence* has an effect on its own right. It is their 'being' rather than their 'doing' which is efficacious, since it is consequential either for society as a whole of for some social organization. Thus if there are simply too many or too few in a given place or time (to feed or to fight) their very *presence* creates exigencies for decision-makers and makes a real difference to what policies can be enacted. *Their being there* constitutes part, the human part, of the *environment* which those actors who can do otherwise have to confront and in confronting it they are constrained in what they actually can do."

132:  "structure cannot be rendered in terms of 'social practices', without any remainder, save their material element. [...] agents cannot be construed in terms of 'social practices' without remainder, save their biological element."

133:  "an approach based upon analytical dualism, where structure and agency are interrelated but not viewed as mutually constitutive since each possesses emergent properties particular to that level."

Chapter 5: Realism and Morphogenesis
-

135:  "Social theory has to be useful and usable: it is not an end in itself."

135:  "there is a glaring absence of bold social theories which uncompromisingly make 'emergence' their central tenet."

Are there any non-bold social theories which compromisingly make emergence their central tenet?

136:  "Forewarned that the signposts reading 'reductionism' and 'reification' are roads to hell paved with bad conceptualizations, no doubt central conflation promises ontological security to more and more theorists. Yet theirs is a very pharisaical self-satisfaction. They expect thanks for not being guilty of grasping at atomism, or unjustly privileging society or the individual, or of whoring with social facts. They congratulate themselves on their theoretical abstemiousness in dieting only on areductionism and on the tithes of hard syncretic endeavour it has taken to consolidate their position. Then they compare themselves favourably with those of us who freely confess that theory is in a mess, that we can point to few worthwhile offerings--but believe the only thing to do is to admit it, confront it, and hope to do something about it."

TMSA Transformational Model of Social Action (Bhaskar)

M/M morphogenetic/morphostatic approach (Archer)

141:  "The peculiarity of all things social is that they are activity dependent. Without human activity nothing in society could have its genesis, continuation, or undergo change. On this we can all agree: unlike nature, social reality is not self-subsistent."

148:  "It is affirmed that social structures are only efficacious through the activities of human beings, but in the only acceptable manner, by allowing that these are the effects of *past actions*, often by long dead people, which survive them (and this temporal escape is precisely what makes them *sui generis*). Thus they continue to exert their effects upon subsequent actors and their activities, as autonomous possessors of causal powers. How they carry over and how they exert their effects is just what the M/M approach attempts to theorize."

151:  "realism itself is *predicated* upon analytical dualism."

157:  Basic theorems of M/M model "which constitute analytical dualism are (i) the structure necessarily pre-dates the action(s) which transform it [...] and; (ii) and that structural elaboration necessarily post-dates those actions which have transformed it"

159:  "realism itself is committed to an explanatory framework which acknowledges and incorporates (a) *pre-existent structures* as generative mechanisms, (b) their *interplay* with other objects possessing causal powers and liabilities proper to them in what is a stratified social world, and (c) non-predictable but none the less explicable *outcomes* arising from interactions between the above, which take place in the open system that is society."

Chapter 6: Analytical Dualism: The Basis of the Morphogenetic Approach
-

165:  "Society is that which nobody wnts, in the form in which they encounter it, for it is an unintended consequence."

165:  "in asserting that society is never exactly what anyone wants, in emphasizing this as the underlying motor of change, in stressing that the social origins of particular transformations lie in structured struggles, in underlining that resulting social forms are generated and elaborated from this parallelogram of pressures, it is also acknowledged that social *structuring*, as a process which is continuously activity-dependent is also one which is uncontrolled, non-teleological, non-homeostatic, non-adaptive and therefore unpredictable."

166:  "Hence the use of the term 'morphogenesis' to describe the process of social structuring; 'morpho' indicating shape, and 'genesis' signalling that the shaping is the product of social relations. Thus 'Morphogenesis' refers to 'those processes which tend to elaborate or change a system's given form, state or structure'. Conversely, 'morphostasis' refers to those processes in complex system-environmental exchanges which tend to preserve or maintain a system's given form, organisation or state."

166:  "Only on the metaphysical assumption that some relations are necessary and at least relatively enduring can we reasonably set out to practise science or to study society. Transcendentally, the world has to be ordered for science to have any success as a practice and its cumulative successes (not construed as undeviating linear progress) furnish increasing warrants for this metaphysical assertion."

167:  "The morphogenetic approach begins the other way around, that is with the essential transcendental commitment to society not being wholly contingent, but with no substantive pre-conceptions that its ordering resembles any other form of reality (mechanical or organic), nor that the whole is homologous with some part of it (language), or some state of it (simple cybernetic systems). Society is only like itself and the basic task is to conceptualize how ordered social forms have their genesis in human agency, just as social beings have their genesis in social forms."

167:  "Since the existence of effects cannot serve to explain origins (a prime error of functionalism) then the task of social theory cannot be restricted to the mere identification of social structures as emergent properties, it must also supply an analytical history of their emergence which accounts for why matters are so and not otherwise."

168-9: Four basic propositions:

1. "there are internal and necessary relations within and between social structures (SS)"
2. "causal influences are exerted by social structure(s) (SS) on social interaction (SI)"
3. "there are causal relationships between groups and individuals at the level of social interaction (SI)"
4. "social interaction (SI) elaborates upon the composition of social structure(s) (SS) by modifying current internal and necessary structural relationships and introducing new ones where morphogenesis is concerned. Alternatively, social interaction (SI) reproduces existing internal and necessary structural relations when morphostasis applies."

169: Compare with argument of *Culture and Agency*:

1. "there are internal and necessary logical relationships between components of the Cultural System (CS)"
2. "causal influences are exerted by the Cultural System (CS) on Socio-Cultural interaction (the S-C level)"
3. "there are causal relationships between groups and individuals at the Socio-Cultural (S-C) level" 
4. "there is elaboration of the Cultural System (CS) due to Socio-Cultural Interaction (S-C) modifying current logical relationships and introducing new ones, where morphogenesis is concerned. Alternatively Socio-Cultural Interaction (S-C) reproduces existing internal and necessary cultural relations when morphostatis applies."

172:  "Any emergent property is held to be something quite different from an overt and relatively enduring patterning in social life."

173:  "Fundamentally, what distinguishes an 'emergent property' is its real homogeneity, namely that the relations between its components are internal and necessary ones rather than seemingly regular concatenations of heterogeneous features--of unknown provenance, undetermined internal influence and uncertain duration. In contradistinction, the primary distinguishing feature of any emergent property is the natural necessity of its internal relations, for what the entity is and its very existence depends on them. To focus upon internal and necessary relations between components as constitutive of an emergent property is to set them apart from relations which are external and contingent. In the latter case, two entities or items can exist without one another and it is thus neither necessary nor impossible that they stand in any particular relation to one another, for the nature of either does not depend on this."

174:  "Natural necessity only states that X cannot be what it is without certain constituents A, B, C, N' and the relations between them. But what is it about X which leads us to attach the concept of 'emergence' to it rather than simply viewing X as the name given to the particular combination or permutation of A, B, C, N'? The crucial distinguishing property is that X itself, and itself being a relational property, has the generative capacity to modify the powers of its constituents in fundamental ways and to exercise causal influences *sui generis*. This is the litmus test which differentiates between emergence on the one hand and aggregation and combination on the other."

175:  "In society there are a variety of emergent properties--structural, cultural and agential, each of which is irreducible to the others, has relative autonomy, and is also relatively enduring."

175:  "What differentiates a *structural* emergent property is its *primary dependence upon material resources*, both physical and human. In other words, the internal and necessary relations between its constituents are fundamentally material ones: those make it what it is and without them it could neither exist as such nor possess the causal powers which characterize it."

177:  "we do not identify structures by interviewing people about them"

177:  "*structural* emergent properties (SEPs), irreducible to people and relatively enduring, as with all incidences of emergence, are specifically defined as those internal and necessary relationships which entail material resources, whether physical or human, and which generate causal powers proper to the relation itself."

177:  "Equally, emergent properties (of which SEPs are but one type) are distinguished from aggregate consequences, for however important the effects of the latter may be, they can always be disaggregated into the sum of individual actions, that is they are reducible."

184:  "the fact that agency itself is the bearer of emergent powers. Thus, on the one hand, *any form of socio-cultural conditioning only exerts its effects on people and is only efficacious through people*. [...] On the other hand, agential relations themselves represent emergent powers (PEPs or people's emergent properties) with their two defining features--that is they modify the capacities of component members (affecting their consciousness and commitments, affinities and animosities) and exert causal powers proper to their relations themselves *vis-a-vis* other agents or their groupings (such as association, organization, opposition and articulation of interests)."

184:  "When we differentiate between the 'parts' (SEPs plus CEPs) and the 'people' in order to examine their interplay, this is *not* therefore a matter of investigating the impact of structural and cultural emergents upon an undifferentiated and unstratified environment whose constituents happens to be people. Instead, it is a question of the confluence between two sets of emergent powers--those of the 'parts' and those of the 'people' (PEPs)."

190:  "we are *always* dealing with the doubel *morphogenesis/statis*--of structure and of agency as part and parcel of the self-same process."

Chapter 7: Structural and Cultural Conditioning
-

195:  Citing Bhaskar, *The Possibility of Naturalism*, 25-6: "The Realist is committed to maintaining that the 'causal powers of social forms is mediated through social agency'." This protects against reification and "endorses the view that agents are the only efficient causes in social life." "both material and ideational emergent properties (SEPs and CEPs) exist and are the bearers of causal powers."

195:  Result is that there are two kinds of causal powers (EPs=parts and people=agents). But only people=agents possess "efficient causality." Why is this the case? How can EPs be influential at all?

195:  "Structural and cultural condition it will be maintained are quintessentially matters of mediation, *and the first phase of the morphogenetic cycle is therefore concerned with mediatory processes*."

195:  "THe one factor which guarantees that social systems remain open (and even precludes thought experiments about closure), is that they are necessarily peopled."

195-6:  "People, in turn, are capable of resisting, repudiating, suspending or circumventing structural and cultural tendencies, in ways which are unpredictable because of their creative powers as human beings. In other words, the exercise of socio-cultural powers is dependent *inter alia* upon their reception and realization by people: their effect is not direct but mediated, for there are no other ways in which it could be exercised without invoking impersonal social forces. What adds to the complexity is that it is equally the case that the exercise of agential powers (whether of individuals or groups) can be suspended, modified, re-directed etc. by the social forms in which they are developed and deployed. There is no need to deny these influences or to minimize their effects, for however profound these are they still work through people who remain the efficient cause of their actualization. The difference then between the two kinds of entities and their respective powers is not one of relative influence but of mode of operation, where the effects of the 'parts' are necessarily mediated, whilst the agents stand as mediators."

196:  "Invariably, from the morphogenetic perspective, *all* structural influences (i.e. the generative powers of SEPs and CEPs) *are mediated to people by shaping the situations in which they find themselves*."

196:  "how mediation takes place and will characterize this as an *objective influence which conditions action patterns and supplies agents with strategic directional guidance*."

196:  "emergent structures represent objective limitations upon the situations and settings which agents can encounter."

197:  "Objectively, it delimits that which *can* be reproduced, re-formulated, rejected or transformed."

198:  "it is only be respecting the powers of people (i.e. not treating them as 'indeterminate material') that the powers of the 'parts' can exert a conditioning influence in a non-reified manner. One of the most important differentiating powers proper to people is their intentionality--their capacity to entertain projects and design strategies to accomplish them (which may or may not be successful). Here, the term 'project' stands for any goal countenanced by a social agent, from the satisfaction of biologically grounded needs to the utopian reconstruction of society."

199:  "A non-reified account of structural and cultural conditioning thus *requires* an active agent in order to mediate the process."

200:  "structures (SEPs and CEPs) fundamentally exert their effects in relation to and actually through the projects entertained by agents."

200:  "the powers of people mean the projects they are capable of conceiving can imaginatively outstrip the social possibilities of their times."

201-3:  people are subject to "involuntaristic placement" in situations.

203-5:  people in situations, by virtue of involuntaristic placement, are subject to "vested interests" in those situations; most obviously, but not exclusively, in terms of maintenance or change. These are just as unavoidable as the involuntaristic placement in a situation.

204:  "vested interests are concerned with relative advantages rather than absolute well-being."

205-8:  this leads to "opportunity costs." 

206:  "There are two major ways in which opportunity costs exert their influence; firstly on the attainment of the same given project and secondly upon which projects can be entertained. The former works through allocating different costs for the *same course of action* to those who are differently situated."
