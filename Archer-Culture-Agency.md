Archer, Margaret S. *Culture and Agency: The Place of Culture in Social Theory*, Revised Edition. CUP, 1996[1988].
===

Note: first volume in a "trilogy" of works elucidating a general critical realist social theory. *Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach* (CUP,1995) is the second volume and *Being Human: The Problem of Agency* (CUP, 2000) is the third volume. Since then has reconceived her project as providing the ontology for relational sociology's analytical framework. The trilogy does valuable work in clearing away "methodological individualism" and "methodological collectivism" through a new articulation of the relation between structure/agency called "the morphogenetic approach," but the account of the social is rather thing: only humans. 

Note: the is a second trilogy that elaborates on these themes in the context of reflexivity as constitutive of the late modern experience: *Structure, Agency, and the Internal Conversation* (CUP, 2003), *Making Our Way Through the World: Human Reflexivity and Social Mobility* (CUP, 2007), and *The Reflexive Imperative in Late Modernity* (CUP, 2012).

Preface
---

xi:  structure/agency is "rightly" the basic issue of modern social theory, but this has obscured the problem of culture/agency. Fortunately, both problems "raise identical difficulties and the method by which can they be resolved turns out to be exactly the same."

xi:  structure and culture are (1) substantially different domains; (2) relatively autonomous from one another.

xi:  Two considerations: (1) concepts used "have to respect and capture the substantive differences" because failing to do so would "[elide] the material and ideational aspect of social life" and (2) theory of structure=>social agent and culture=>cultural actor because we "be violating our ability to understand social life as the interplay between interests and ideas."

xii:  "the urgency of the problem of structure and agency is not one which imposes itself on academics alone, but on every human being."

xii:  "confronting the most pressing social problem of the human condition."

xiv-xxix:  proposes five theses on culture/agency: (1) on conflation [xiv-xvi], (2) on analytical dualism [xvi-xix], (3) on the interface [xix-xxiv], (4) on morphogenesis and morphostasis [xxiv-xxvii], and (5) on unification [xxvii-xxix].

xiv:  conflation: point is to "link" structure/culture to agency rather than "sink" them into one another because despite the proximity of phenomena, they are analytically distinct. "the 'parts' and the 'people' are *not* co-existent through time and therefore any approach which amalgamates them wrongly foregoes the possibility of examining the interplay between them over time."

xvi:  analytical dualism: "there is no suggestion that we are dealing with separate entities, only analytically separable ones and ones which it is theoretically useful to treat separately." Develops analytical dualism in culture through analogy with Lockwood. 

David Lockwood, "Social Integration and System Integration," in *Explorations in Social Change*, edited by G.K. Zollschan and W. Hirshch, #-##?. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1964.

xvii:  refers to Durkheim's lectures on evolution of educational thought for giving material to come up with a cultural counterpart to Lockwood--"cultural contradictions" and "cultural complementaries."

xviii:  Cultural System [CS] integration, "the degree of logical consistency," "relations between the components of culture"; Socio-Cultural integration [S-C], "the extent of causal cohesion," "relationships between cultural agents." "The CS/S-C distinction therefore maps onto that between culture without a knowing subject and culture with a knowing subject."

xviii:  "culture as a whole is taken to refer to all intelligibilia, that is to any item which has the dispositional capacity of being understood by someone. Within this I then distinguish the Cultural System, which is that sub-set of items to which the law of contradiction can be applied. There are propositions, for only statements which assert truth or falsity can be deemed to be in contradictio or to be consistent with one another. In turn this means that the Cultural System is restricted to the propositional register of society at any given time. The justification for defining the CS in this way rest partly on the fact that it meets the criterion of methodological workability, but partly, too, on the self-evident importance of those things held to be true or false in society at any given time or place."

xviii-xix:  "we generate myths, are moved by mysteries, become rich in symbolics and ruthless in manipulating hidden persuaders. But all of these elements are precisely the stuff of Socio-Cultural interaction. For they are all matters of interpersonal influence, whether we are talking at one extreme of hermeneutic understanding (including religious experience at the furthest extremity) or of the manipulative assault and battery of ideas used ideologically. All those other non-propositional things to which we assent or over which we dissent--such as tastes and preferences, likes and dislikes, affinities and animosities, patriotism and prejudice--lie in between. And all of this takes place outside of, *en d√©pit de*, the cannons of logic, whether knowingly on the part of actors (proclaiming the mystery of faith), or whether imposed on unknowing others (recipients of symbolic machinations), or whether as that semi-knowledgeable mish-mash called 'public opinion.'"

xix:  "Clearly the Cultural System and Socio-Cultural life do not exist or operate independently of one another; they overlap, intertwine and are mutually influential." Hence, the point is not that they are distinct (i.e., dualism), but that *analytical* dualism is the only way the interplay between the two can be adequately explored/explained.

xx:  interface: "how do we conceptualize their [CS/S-C] interplay; and, through this, how do we gain theoretical leverage upon cultural dynamics?" "My objective is to theorize about the *conditions* for cultural stability or change, and my basic hypothesis is that these conditions are rooted in the *conjunction* between the Cultural System and the Socio-Cultural interaction--just as they are grounded in the conjuncture between social and system integration in the structural domain."

xxi:  "Generically it is how contradictory or complementary relations between 'parts' of the Cultural System map onto orderly or conflictual relationships between 'people' at the Socio-Cultural level which determines whether the outcome is cultural stability or change. This means that we need to specify, first, which Systemic relations impinge upon agency and how they do so; and, second, which social relations affect how agents respond to and react back on the Cultural System."

xxi:  "analysis does *not* begin with a complete description of the Cultural System: a full itemization of its contradictions and complementarities being both impossible and irrelevant. Instead we start with *the ideas which at any given time have holders*, and restrict ourselves to these items. For only if an item is held by someone can its logical relationships with other items have any effect on agency."

xxii:  "contradictions mould problem-ridden situations for actors which they must confront *if and when* they realize, or are made to acknowledge, that they proposition(s) they endorse is enmeshed in some inconsistency. What they do next is not determined: they have the options of irrational dogmatism or of abandoning the theory or belief altogether, *but* if they want to go on holding it non-dogmatically then their only recourse is to repair the inconsistency, that is the force of the situational logic. By contrast, complementarities mould problem-free situations for agents who can explore their ideational environments without danger or difficulty and from this build up an elaborate conspectus, the elements of which are mutually consistent and reinforcing. This by contrast fosters a situational logic of reproduction aimed at retaining this felicitous cluster and discouraging alterations in it."

xxii:  "these Systemic influences are only part of the story about how cultural situations are moulded for actors. The other part is made up of the causal relations operating between groups and individuals at the Socio-Cultural level. Such relationships have their own dynamics, rooted in different material interests, producing various forms of social stratification and different ideal interests, such as ethnic, religious or linguistic divides (which are ideational but not propositional). These make their own contribution to cultural stability or change through the influences they exert upon what actors do on the spot. They form the other side of the interface and are thus co-determinants (with Systemic conditioning) of what actually takes place there. Systemic conditioning only appears (and this is nothing more than appearance) to be decisive when Socio-Cultural influences happen to be pulling in the same direction. It is, therefore, easier to pin-point their independent contribution when social orderliness or disorderliness are pulling in different directions, that is operating at variance with Systemic conditioning. Under such conditions one readily identify the main ways in which they work at the interface."
