Note: first volume in a "trilogy" of works elucidating a general critical realist social theory. *Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach* (CUP,1995) is the second volume and *Being Human: The Problem of Agency* (CUP, 2000) is the third volume. Since then has reconceived her project as providing the ontology for relational sociology's analytical framework. The trilogy does valuable work in clearing away "methodological individualism" and "methodological collectivism" through a new articulation of the relation between structure/agency called "the morphogenetic approach," but the account of the social is rather thing: only humans. 

Note: the is a second trilogy that elaborates on these themes in the context of reflexivity as constitutive of the late modern experience: *Structure, Agency, and the Internal Conversation* (CUP, 2003), *Making Our Way Through the World: Human Reflexivity and Social Mobility* (CUP, 2007), and *The Reflexive Imperative in Late Modernity* (CUP, 2012).

Note: at conclusion of second chapter, it remains unclear as to what specifically is meant by "culture," especially in comparison to "social" or "structure." Presumably, positive content--along with analytical concepts or "units"--will be introduced following the negative critique conflationism.

Preface
---

xi:  structure/agency is "rightly" the basic issue of modern social theory, but this has obscured the problem of culture/agency. Fortunately, both problems "raise identical difficulties and the method by which can they be resolved turns out to be exactly the same."

xi:  structure and culture are (1) substantially different domains; (2) relatively autonomous from one another.

xi:  Two considerations: (1) concepts used "have to respect and capture the substantive differences" because failing to do so would "[elide] the material and ideational aspect of social life" and (2) theory of structure=>social agent and culture=>cultural actor because we "be violating our ability to understand social life as the interplay between interests and ideas."

xii:  "the urgency of the problem of structure and agency is not one which imposes itself on academics alone, but on every human being."

xii:  "confronting the most pressing social problem of the human condition."

xiv-xxix:  proposes five theses on culture/agency: (1) on conflation [xiv-xvi], (2) on analytical dualism [xvi-xix], (3) on the interface [xix-xxiv], (4) on morphogenesis and morphostasis [xxiv-xxvii], and (5) on unification [xxvii-xxix].

xiv:  conflation: point is to "link" structure/culture to agency rather than "sink" them into one another because despite the proximity of phenomena, they are analytically distinct. "the 'parts' and the 'people' are *not* co-existent through time and therefore any approach which amalgamates them wrongly foregoes the possibility of examining the interplay between them over time."

xvi:  analytical dualism: "there is no suggestion that we are dealing with separate entities, only analytically separable ones and ones which it is theoretically useful to treat separately." Develops analytical dualism in culture through analogy with Lockwood. 

David Lockwood, "Social Integration and System Integration," in *Explorations in Social Change*, edited by G.K. Zollschan and W. Hirshch, #-##?. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1964.

xvii:  refers to Durkheim's lectures on evolution of educational thought for giving material to come up with a cultural counterpart to Lockwood--"cultural contradictions" and "cultural complementaries."

xviii:  Cultural System [CS] integration, "the degree of logical consistency," "relations between the components of culture"; Socio-Cultural integration [S-C], "the extent of causal cohesion," "relationships between cultural agents." "The CS/S-C distinction therefore maps onto that between culture without a knowing subject and culture with a knowing subject."

xviii:  "culture as a whole is taken to refer to all intelligibilia, that is to any item which has the dispositional capacity of being understood by someone. Within this I then distinguish the Cultural System, which is that sub-set of items to which the law of contradiction can be applied. There are propositions, for only statements which assert truth or falsity can be deemed to be in contradictio or to be consistent with one another. In turn this means that the Cultural System is restricted to the propositional register of society at any given time. The justification for defining the CS in this way rest partly on the fact that it meets the criterion of methodological workability, but partly, too, on the self-evident importance of those things held to be true or false in society at any given time or place."

xviii-xix:  "we generate myths, are moved by mysteries, become rich in symbolics and ruthless in manipulating hidden persuaders. But all of these elements are precisely the stuff of Socio-Cultural interaction. For they are all matters of interpersonal influence, whether we are talking at one extreme of hermeneutic understanding (including religious experience at the furthest extremity) or of the manipulative assault and battery of ideas used ideologically. All those other non-propositional things to which we assent or over which we dissent--such as tastes and preferences, likes and dislikes, affinities and animosities, patriotism and prejudice--lie in between. And all of this takes place outside of, *en d√©pit de*, the cannons of logic, whether knowingly on the part of actors (proclaiming the mystery of faith), or whether imposed on unknowing others (recipients of symbolic machinations), or whether as that semi-knowledgeable mish-mash called 'public opinion.'"

xix:  "Clearly the Cultural System and Socio-Cultural life do not exist or operate independently of one another; they overlap, intertwine and are mutually influential." Hence, the point is not that they are distinct (i.e., dualism), but that *analytical* dualism is the only way the interplay between the two can be adequately explored/explained.

xx:  interface: "how do we conceptualize their [CS/S-C] interplay; and, through this, how do we gain theoretical leverage upon cultural dynamics?" "My objective is to theorize about the *conditions* for cultural stability or change, and my basic hypothesis is that these conditions are rooted in the *conjunction* between the Cultural System and the Socio-Cultural interaction--just as they are grounded in the conjuncture between social and system integration in the structural domain."

xxi:  "Generically it is how contradictory or complementary relations between 'parts' of the Cultural System map onto orderly or conflictual relationships between 'people' at the Socio-Cultural level which determines whether the outcome is cultural stability or change. This means that we need to specify, first, which Systemic relations impinge upon agency and how they do so; and, second, which social relations affect how agents respond to and react back on the Cultural System."

xxi:  "analysis does *not* begin with a complete description of the Cultural System: a full itemization of its contradictions and complementarities being both impossible and irrelevant. Instead we start with *the ideas which at any given time have holders*, and restrict ourselves to these items. For only if an item is held by someone can its logical relationships with other items have any effect on agency."

xxii:  "contradictions mould problem-ridden situations for actors which they must confront *if and when* they realize, or are made to acknowledge, that they proposition(s) they endorse is enmeshed in some inconsistency. What they do next is not determined: they have the options of irrational dogmatism or of abandoning the theory or belief altogether, *but* if they want to go on holding it non-dogmatically then their only recourse is to repair the inconsistency, that is the force of the situational logic. By contrast, complementarities mould problem-free situations for agents who can explore their ideational environments without danger or difficulty and from this build up an elaborate conspectus, the elements of which are mutually consistent and reinforcing. This by contrast fosters a situational logic of reproduction aimed at retaining this felicitous cluster and discouraging alterations in it."

xxii:  "these Systemic influences are only part of the story about how cultural situations are moulded for actors. The other part is made up of the causal relations operating between groups and individuals at the Socio-Cultural level. Such relationships have their own dynamics, rooted in different material interests, producing various forms of social stratification and different ideal interests, such as ethnic, religious or linguistic divides (which are ideational but not propositional). These make their own contribution to cultural stability or change through the influences they exert upon what actors do on the spot. They form the other side of the interface and are thus co-determinants (with Systemic conditioning) of what actually takes place there. Systemic conditioning only appears (and this is nothing more than appearance) to be decisive when Socio-Cultural influences happen to be pulling in the same direction. It is, therefore, easier to pin-point their independent contribution when social orderliness or disorderliness are pulling in different directions, that is operating at variance with Systemic conditioning. Under such conditions one readily identify the main ways in which they work at the interface."

xxiii:  "It is universally the case that Socio-Cultural imbalances, and the power differentials deriving from them, affect the degree of awareness or 'discursive penetration' that actors have of ideational contradictions or complementaries themselves. Thus, for example, when some dominant material-interest group supports a set of propositions which are embroiled in contradiction, they will use their power to control the visibility of inconsistent items through a variety of 'containment strategies', the most blatant of which is censorship. If successful, the subordinate agents will remain unruffled by the inconsistencies attending the group's beliefs for they are in the dark about them; the Systemic fault-line represented by the contradiction will remain unexploited, even by those who have the interests to split it wide open, because power has kept it unperceived. Consequently, in this instance, social imbalance produces orderly Socio-Cultural relations, maintaining the cultural status quo whilever agents' access to information can be controlled."

xiii:  "the nature of Socio-Cultural relations affects which of the responses forged under the pressure of the situational logic can actually be made to stick. Again, fundamentally and universally no corrective formula (generated to repair contradictions) and no reproductive scheme (elaborated to protect complementarities) can be made to 'take' in society when the contemporaneous distribution of interests and power do not gel with it. Instead a variety of ideational shifts will be registered depending on the nature of the disjuncture to counter-actualization and including schismatism and Specialization."

xxiv:  morphogenesis/morphostability: "the unique feature distinguishing social Systems from organic or mechanical ones is their capacity to undergo radical restructuring." Morphogenesis refers to "the complex interchanges that produce change in a System's given form, structure or state [...] the end product being termed 'Elaboration'." Morphostasis is the opposite process. "the morphogenetic perspective is not only dualistic but sequential, dealing in endless three-part cycles of Structural Conditioning -> Social interaction -> Structural Elaboration. The suggestion is that this framework be transferred to the cultural field, using equivalent analytic phases (i.e., Cultural Conditioning -> Socio-Cultural interaction -> Cultural Elaboration), in order to unravel the dialectical interplay of culture and agency over time."

xxiv:  this requires that time be central to social theory. "Time is incorporated as a theoretical variable rather than simply as a medium in which events take place."

xxv:  "culture and agency operate over different time periods." 

xxv:  "the Cultural System logically predates the Socio-Cultural action(s) which transform it; and that Cultural Elaboration logically post-dates such interaction."

xxvii:  unification: "the possible conceptual and theoretical unification of structural and cultural analysis from the morphogenetic perspective."

xviii:  "But utilizing this common framework it becomes easier to see *how* structure and culture intersect in the middle element of their respective morphogenetic cycles: through structural-interest groups endorsing some corpus of ideas in order to advance their material concerns but then becoming enmeshed in the situational logic of that part of the cultural domain; and through ideal-interest groups seeking powerful sponsors to promote their ideas but then immediately embroiling cultural discourse in power-lay within the structural domain."

Chapter 1: The Myth of Cultural Integration
---

1:  Culture has "the weakest analytical development of any key concept in sociology [...]"

1:  Descriptive level: "remains inordinately vague despite little dispute that it is indeed a core concept," "there are as yet no 'units' for describing culture," "instead of different 'cultural structures' there are endless 'cultural differences'."

1:  Explanatory level: "culture swings from being the prime mover (credited with engulfing and orchestrating the entire social structure) to the opposite extreme where it is reduced to a mere epiphenomenon (charged only with providing an ideational representation of culture)."

Are these two claims (descriptive, explanatory) still true in light of the development of Jeff Alexander's strong program in cultural sociology?

3:  a priori assumption regarding culture derives from anthropological theory: "On the one hand, its strong aesthetic rather than analytical orientation, which led to an endorsement of '"artistic" hermeneutics as the method for grasping the inner sense of cultural wholes'. On the other hand this approach, based on the intuitive understanding of cultural configurations, entailed a crucial prejudgement, namely an insistence that coherence was there to be found, that is a mental closure against the discovery of cultural inconsistencies."

4:  the standard appropriation of culture in sociological theory confounds two issues. First, logical consistency, "the degree of internal compatibility between the components of culture" and, second, casual consensus, "the degree of social uniformity produced by the imposition of culture [...] by one set of people on another."

4:  "The main proposition advanced here is that the two are logically and empirically distinct, hence they can vary independently of one another."

5:  "Power relations are the causal element in cultural consensus building and, far from unproblematically guaranteeing behavioural conformity, they can provoke anything from ritualistic acceptance to outright rejection of the culture imposed."

6:  "the basic deficiency of the anthropological heritage, as appropriated in sociology, was that it resisted making any analytical distinctions at all. The net effect of this insistence on cultural compactness was that it precluded any theory of cultural development springing from internal dynamics."

7:  "The image of cultural coherence is grounded in traditional society."

14:  "the theoretical incorporation of inconsistency at the Systemic level does two things: it specifies certain necessary conditions for stability or change in the Cultural System. Every contradiction represents a potential for change. Whether it does lead to this rather than to active containment depends on the activities of groups and individuals at the Socio-Cultural level. Thus the second implication of giving due attention to the flaws in Cultural System integration is the necessity of distinguishing this level analytically from Socio-Cultural integration--for the latter determines the fate of those discontinuities, that is whether they are amplified into recognisable changes or damped down to preserve the picture of social continuity."

15:  "cultural coherence may not stem from the integration of the Cultural System but from the lack of alternatives to it--and this itself is a property of the System. Too frequently it has been presumed to be a property of the Socio-Cultural level."

15-6:  "Equally this question of alternatives (like our discussions of inconsistencies) is linked to the conditions of cultural stability or change. The existence of alternatives at the Systemic level, or the presence of *variety* as it is termed in information theory, is essential for *adaptive Systems*. This mathematical theory postulates some source which continuously generates variety (new signals, symbols, messages) and some receiver who can put this variety to use." This view from information theory is helpful in two regards: first, "alternatives (variety) must be available to be drawn upon the Systemic level" and, second, "that there must be receivers at the Socio-Cultural level who are willing and able to make use of them."

18:  "cultural poverty is like physical poverty--grinding."

18:  "Primitive cultural accumulation is almost as difficult as primitive capital accumulation and is, of course, related to it."

20-1:  "In the first case (typical of normative functionalism) the Myth was restated in terms of 'downwards' conflation. Here, Cultural System integration engulfs Socio-Cultural integration through processes of orchestration, regulation and internalization. In the opposite case (represented by neo-Marxism) the Myth was re-instated in the form of 'upwards' conflation. Basically the Socio-Cultural level swallows up the Cultural System as the effect of social domination and ideological manipulation. Finally, just as both of these versions were becoming rather frayed under the wear and tear of criticism, the Myth was suddenly revitalized by a brand new exposition of it--this time taking the form of 'central' conflation (typified by the 'structuration' approach). This was not merely another shot in the arm: rather it extended an eternal life-support system to the Myth by seeking to banish for good the analytical dualism, one which the present critique depends. To these theorists the Myth did indeed elide the Systemic and Socio-Cultural levels--but rightly so. Since the two were mutually constitutive and consequently inseparable, it was therefore improper to analyse them dualistically. That this full-frontal defence of the inexorable duality of culture was even less capable of providing a theory of cultural change than the two preceding forms of conflation, is taken here to constitute the final condemnation of the whole conflationary procedure."

21:  "The common denominator of the various conflationists who buttress the Myth of Cultural integration is that they elide logical relations with causal connections and then judge this *ensemble* to make a coherent whole. On the contrary, an approach based on analytical dualism challenges this judgement and the premisses on which it is founded. Instead, by distinguishing logical relations (pertaining to the Cultural System) form the causal relations (pertaining to the SOcio-Cultural level) and allowing of their independent variation, the interface between them becomes a problematic area for intensive exploration. The results of this would identify the *conditions* for integration in the cultural realm, without that state of affairs being taken as a foregone conclusion--any more than it can be in the structural domain. Cultural integration is demythologized by rendering it contingent upon the particular patterning of inter-connections *at* the two different levels and *between* the two different levels."

Chapter 2: 'Downwards Conflation': on keys, codes and cohesion
---

Discussing Functionalism and Structuralism as modes of downwards conflation

28-9:  "As far as the analysis of the Cultural System is concerned the 'essence of the logico-meaningful method of cognition is ... in the finding of the central principle (the 'reason') which permeates all the components, gives sense and significance to each of them, and in this way makes cosmos of a chaos of unintegrated fragments'. But how do we avoid imposing a meaning which is simply not there, or how do we validate the meanings we claim to detect? Sorokin's answer is that we avoid false attribution by identifying the 'major premise of each system', and are subsequently confirmed in the correctness of our identification by the fact that this 'major premise' will then act as 'the key', in conjunction with the canons of logic, to 'the nature of the entire unity'. The presumption that there is a key to be found, which is itself predicated on the assumption that Cultural Systems are coherently ordered, though not obviously so at first glance, is Sorokin's lasting bequest to sociology."

Discussing Peter Sorokin, *Social and Cultural Dynamics*. London: Peter Owen, 1957.

29:  However, Sorokin is unable to specify how this key (or code) is identified and how what is identified is known to be correct; e.g., does not seem to recognize possibility of selective or false identification. Likewise, he claims there are two ideal types of Cultural Systems (Ideational, Sensate), but recognizes that the idea types rarely exist in pure form, thus leading to the conclusion that the vast majority of Cultural Systems are composed of various mixes of the two. But, there is no reason to assume that the mix is in any way coherent. Sorokin notes, "Thus the logic of such a cultural type is often nonlogical or illogical."

31:  "Because of the empirical predominance of 'mixture' at the Systemic level, Sorokin is driven to talk not about influence of *the* Cultural System but about the effect of the *dominant* culture. [...] what makes the dominant dominate remains an enigma, since Sorokin never grounds domination in social interaction."

33:  "mainstream [Parsonian] Functionalism pressed on with downwards conflation in a more sophisticated but also more rigid form."

33:  Blake & Davis: fallacy of normative determinism--"the error of assuming that because norms (at the Cultural System level) are meant to control behaviour, then this is sufficient ground for assuming that they successfully do so (at the Socio-Cultural level)."

35:  "Like Sorokin he [Parsons] can offer no mechanism for *accounting* for the predominance of certain values."

38-9:  "the superficial appearance which culture presented to its observers was closer to the old imagery of 'booming, buzzing confusion', but its hidden interconnections could be explicated by detection of an underlying and covert *code* which regulated them. The basic idea, stemming from linguistic structuralism, was that cultures could be decoded. The fundamental premiss here is obviously that Cultural Systems are in fact encoded (ontologically they are codes): the fundamental methodological implication for sociology is clearly that its task is to decipher them."

39:  Structuralists had Durkheim, Mauss, Saussure in background, but drew especially on Chomsky; specifically, two principles: "that of a limited number of generative principles underlying any linguistic manifestation, and the associated idea of 'rule-governed creativity', that is the possible production of unlimited manifestations which were none the less obedient to the code. Already in Chomsky's above notions, the germs of conflation abound. The generative principles (the linguistic code) regulate linguistic creativity (social usage of language). In other words, the independence of the latter (the Socio-Cultural level in our terms) is reduced to its ingenuity in elaborating permutations of the code (the Systemic level in our terms). As the users make and can make no reciprocal contribution to altering the code itself, the downwards inflection is also implicit."

39:  "Essentially the very nature of the structuralist endeavour involves the assumption of *discoverable cultural coherence*."

40:  "Not only is Cultural System integration deemed to be exceedingly high from the structuralist perspective but, in typical conflationist fashion, it is held to generate an equivalent degree of Socio-Cultural integration."

40:  "When carried over [linguistic model of reproducing the language in each grammatical utterance] to the cultural realm it means that to employ any cultural element (cooking a meal, singing a song, gaining a living, explaining the cosmos) invokes the Systemic code and therefore enmeshes those engaging in such activities in its Socio-Cultural reproduction."

43:  "By presuming that Cultural Systems are indeed coded phenomena, they are necessarily assumed to be susceptible of decoding. Hence decipher*ing* becomes a technical problem; decipher*ability* is not questioned, even when it is beyond our present ingenuity."

45:  "The fundamental difficulty of the structuralist position arises from the fact that rival decodings can be advanced by starting from different premisses (that is, binary opposition could be replaced by a 'trinitarian' principle or any other which can plausibly be attributed to our mental constitution): there is no way of adjudicating between them assuming they are all internally consistent."

Chapter 3: 'Upwards Conflation': the manipulated consensus
---

46-7:  "Thus many forms of neo-Marxism take as fundamental precisely that which the downwards conflationists had sedulously neglected--the role of power in the imposition of culture. What differentiates between the two versions of the Myth is not the end-product, which in both cases is a state of cultural integration, but how this is produced: here we are dealing with a manipulated consensus. [...] Here conflation is from the bottom upwards, since it is Socio-Cultural conflict which generates a common Cultural System--usually represented as 'the dominant ideology'."

49:  Archer raises four questions against the dominant ideology thesis:

1. Is there a single dominant culture?
2. Is the dominant culture internally coherent?
3. Do subordinate cultures exist?
4. How is cultural domination produced?

49:  The first question deals with the constitution of the Cultural System. "From Marx, dominant ideology theorists take the basic notion that the Cultural System is articulated by the group which dominates at the Socio-Cultural level--the 'ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas'." But, note, for Marx, ideas is in the plural. However, for most proponents of the dominant ideology thesis, ideas is in the singular. Marx implies that there are multiple strands of ideas that make up the dominant ideas; neo-Marxists seem to deny this. However, while Marx recognizes this "pluralism" (Archer), he denies its importance in the case of conflicts within the ruling class to the extent that the conflict disappears when functionally necessary. Dominant ideology theorists have taken this to mean that there are no conflicts because conflict can disappear when necessary.

50:  However, ideas cannot "disappear" in a real sense: once created, they are part of the Cultural System. The question, then, is how the conflict is resolved at the Socio-Cultural level. "Effectively this then imposed a task on neo-Marxists, namely to specify the actual mechanisms by which the Socio-Cultural level *socially* (not ontologically) nullifies part of the Cultural-System (that is, when the latter threatens the former)."

50-1:  "From Marx is taken the generic stress on the social origins of men's ideas (the very formation of individual consciousness by social conditions) and the particular emphasis on the nexus between material interests and consonant ideas; the 'ruling ideas are nothing more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships grasped as ideas'. Here, then, we have the basic notion of the *causal* level (material social relations) generating the *logical* level, the Cultural System. [...] Instead the dominant ideology theorists reason that because a group has a coherent set of interests these will be given consistent ideational expression."

51:  "Indeed part of the very instrumentality of ideology means that ideologies are matters of convenience, often hastily fabricated, rather than studiously elaborated and double-checked to eliminate contradiction."

52:  "From Marx is taken the fundamental tenet that in each social formation are found 'the ruling ideas of the epoch'." Two possible interpretations. "Soft" only ruling ideas are visible because subordinate groups lack the capacity to give expression to their ideas; "harder" cannot be subordinate culture(s) because all classes are subsumed into a single culture. The dominant ideology thesis assumes the "hard" interpretation.

52:  "Marx thereby implies that *any* epoch can be examined from other than the dominant viewpoint and this in turn must mean that *every* Cultural System can itself furnish at least one alternative vantage point."

53:  "Marx accepts not merely the existence of counter-cultures, but also that they may be distributed quite extensively in society and that collectively they play a continuous role in social conflict."

54:  "The account of how cultural domination is produced relies upon the key role assigned to power by Marx in bringing about a manipulated cultural consensus. Yet even in the original quotation Marx is cautious about the engineering of cultural integration being a foregone conclusion [...] His insertion of the caveat 'generally speaking' indicates that to him such control is no absolute guarantee of the success of this enterprise. The additional assumption introduced by the dominant ideology theorists is that once power is used to manipulate the beliefs of others it will always be successful in generating cultural consensus."

56:  Two versions of Marxism are aligned with upwards conflationism (instrumentalism and critical theory); a third version of Marxism (structuralist) is aligned with downwards conflation.

56:  "The first has been dubbed as 'instrumentalism', because not only does it stress the common point that compliance is brought about by ideological control in capitalist societies but it also emphasizes that this incorporation is achieved by one class *doing* something to another. Thus the manipulated consensus at the Cultural System level is produced through the action of one class on the other(s) at the Socio-Cultural level. The second, which emanates from the Frankfurt school, does not rely upon the indoctrination of one social group by another but rather on how the pursuit of technical interests in advanced industrial societies ultimately results in the mental distortion of the whole human race, that is, the universalization of a 'technocratic consciousness'. What makes it too an exemplar of upward conflation, is that this resulting Cultural System is rooted in interests which arise and are generalized at the Socio-Cultural level."

56:  Instrumentalism, a number of variations, but united in three general views: "a 'class-theoretical' method of analysing culture (that is, classes are the origins of knowledge, belief or ideology); a joint conviction that ideological consensus arises from the activities of an identifiable group of actors; and a shared certainty that the ruling class is universally successful in employing ideology as an instrument which does incorporate all into a single Cultural System."

Chapter 4: 'Central Conflation': the duality of culture
---

Identifies Bauman and Giddens, but not Bourdieu, with this position.

73:  "'culture' should never be detached from human 'agency'. It is neither a floating property which becomes possessed through internalization, nor is it a property created by one group which then possesses others through incorporation. In place of both, central conflationists basically want a concept of culture in which *each and every actor is an active participant*--never a passive recipient or an enforced receiver."

73:  "From the (downwards) Cultural System perspective they wish to salvage the notion of a semiotic order, supplying a corpus of meanings, which is the very medium of action--just as language is the medium which makes speech acts possible. However, what is accentuated here is not that this medium of action traps its users into regulated behaviour (through using it) but rather that it is a necessary resource in the production of *any* act which is to be meaningful."

73:  "From the (upwards) Socio-Cultural perspective they seek to resuscitate the notion of culture as praxis, 'an active constituting process, accomplished by, and consisting in, the doings of active subjects'. Here again there is a considerable shift of emphasis, for this process never boils down to the doings of the dominant minority in mystifying the passive masses. Instead every social actor is held to know a great deal about the production and reproduction of his society and any culture must thus be viewed as resulting from the skilled performances of *each* of its members (not that they will always be able to express what those skills are and not that the results will usually be faithful to their intentions)."

Quoting from Anthony Giddens (1976), *New Rules of Sociological Method*, London: Hutchinson, 121.

76-7:  "Central conflation is a position from which the Cultural System level and the Socio-Cultural level are held to be mutually constitutive. In its general, everyday applications, the notion of mutual constitution allows considerable relative autonomy for the elements involved in it. Thus mutually constitutive concepts like 'cycling', 'singing', 'haystack' or 'officer' are all cases where it is possible to examine the constituent components clearly. Bicycles, songs, bales and armies can be inspected in their own right, independent of human agency, and regardless of their dispositional capacity for being ridden, sung, stacked or manned. In so doing, properties specific to these things can be identified which are quite independent of what people do to them (the colour of a bicycle, length of a song, composition of a bale and size of an army are all examples of such properties). The same goes for the human ingredient. We can, for instance, note differences between agents in the performance of those tasks (such as how well they do them) and in properties they possess which are unrelated to such tasks (such as their marital status). In other words the two constitutive components can be investigated 'dualistically'."

77:  However, central conflationists deny that these two elements *can* be analytically separated. "Culture is held to be such an all-embracing phenomenon, that it represents a kind of global matrix in which all facets of signification (CS) are intertwined with every feature of social practice (S-C). In this totalistic version of mutual constitution, those properties which are independent of one another *within* each mutually constituted element (as in everyday examples), lose this status when inserted into the matrix and 'cross-referenced' with the totality of elements."

78:  mutual constitution must involve not only CS and S-C, but the mutual constitution must happen simultaneously if analytical dualism is to be precluded. Thus, CS must constitute S-C at the same time that S-C constitutes CS.

80:  "It is entirely possible to adopt a position which could be called 'centrism' which indeed accepts that human agents shape culture but are themselves culturally moulded, *without* collapsing the two levels." In other words, the position defended by Archer as analytical dualism.

85-6:  "What both Bauman and Giddens want to unite through the 'duality of culture' notion is both the creativity of actors in introducing cultural metamorphosis (employing their transformative capacity to produce change of real magnitude) and its opposite, the 'ruttedness' of recursively produced actions (generated by drawing on and the reproducing cultural rules), as in bureaucracy where life is constantly breathed into inert regulations which then deaden their animators through routinization. In other words they attempt to use their key concept of 'duality' to transcend the traditional dichotomy between voluntarism and determinism, for they want (quite rightly) to retain something of both."

89:  "So here, it appears to me that the quality of the cultural properties (CS) makes its own contribution to differential malleability, independent of the amount of power actors bring to bear (S-C). Some properties can be changed relatively quickly (tax rules), some take longer to change (knowledge distributions), some prove highly resistant to change (bureaucracy, ethnicity, gender distinctions), and some are unchangeable (historical information lost or irretrievably destroyed). Even more importantly, central configuations of rules (the Law or the Constitution) display this differential mutability *among* their internal components."

89:  "The key point here is not that (most of) these elements are ultimately unalterable: only that it takes different amounts of effort and time to modify them. And during the time it takes to change something, then that thing continues to exert a constraint which cannot be assumed to be insignificant in its social consequences. Nations can fall, polities be depose and economies bankrupted, *while* efforts are being made to change the factors responsible (for example, birth rates, despotism, illiteracy, ethno-centrism). As a general theoretical proposition this holds good however short the time interval involved."

A Summary of Part 1
---

97:  downwards conflation--regulation, socialization; upwards conflation--domination, manipulation. One level is the epiphenomenon of the other; disagreement concerns which level is epiphenomenal. 

98:  "If an adequate theory depends on examining the *interplay* between logical properties and causal processes, then this is predicated on some autonomy or independence being assigned to both Cultural System and Socio-Cultural levels."

99:  Central conflation does not make one element epiphenomenal of the other. Rather, it makes each element co-constitutive of the other. Instead "autonomy is withheld from *both levels* and has precisely the same result of precluding any examination of their interplay."

100:  Model of change in each: downwards--holistic adaptation; upwards--manipulated alteration; central--unpredictable transformations.

Chapter 5: Addressing the Cultural System
---

104:  "At any given time a Cultural System is constituted by the corpus of existing intelligibilia--by all things capable of being grasped, deciphered, understood or known by someone. [...] By definition the cultural intelligibilia form a system, for all items must be expressed in a common language (or be translatable in principle) since this is a precondition of their being intelligible. In other words they have at least one characteristic shared with at least one other component (language) which is also the precondition of them being a system."

104:  From this definition it follows that there is only one Cultural System at any time. Cultural System*s* "strictly refers to differing time periods, such that the system at T~2 compared with T~1 is different because of the growth of knowledge, elaboration of beliefs, accumulation of literacy and so forth."

105:  "the Cultural System is composed of entia which stand in logical relations to one another--the most important of which are those of consistency or contradiction between items since *both* are vital elements in a an adequate theory of cultural stability and change."

105-6:  "by distinguishing logical relations (pertaining to the CS level) from causal ones (pertaining to the S-C level) I want to make the interface between them an area of intensive exploration and theorization, the results of which should say much about the *conditions* of integration, without taking this state to be a foregone conclusion in the cultural realm." 

106: Four propositions to be defended:

> (i) There are logical relationships between components of the Cultural System (CS).

> (ii)  There are causal influences exerted by the CS on the Socio-Cultural (S-C) level.

> (iii) There are causal relationships between groups and individuals at the S-C level.

> (iv) There is elaboration of the CS due to the S-C level modifying current logical relationships and introducing new ones.

106:  The result is a pattern: Cultural Conditioning->Cultural Interaction->Cultural Elaboration. This cycle is continuous such that CE forms the new CC.

106:  "*the prime concern is to establish the existence of objective contradictions and complementarities within a Cultural System, independent of any reference to the S-C level."

107:  "(1) Ontologically it is maintained that there are objective relations of contradiction whose existence is not dependent on people's awareness of them; (2) epistemologically it is claimed that these can be known by reference to invariant logical principles the applicability of which is not relative to time or place; (3) methodologically it is argued that the problems involved in their cross-cultural identification are not intractable."

107:  "As an emergent entity the Cultural System has an objective existence and autonomous relations amongst its components (theories, beliefs, values, arguments, or more strictly between the propositional formulations of them) in the sense that these are independent of anyone's claim to know, to believe, to assert or to assent to them. At any moment the CS is the product of historical Socio-Cultural interaction, but having emerged (emergence being a continuous process) then *qua* product, it has properties of its own. Like structure, culture is man-made but escapes its makers to act back upon them. The CS contains constraints (like the things that can and cannot be said in a particular natural language), it embodies new possibilities (such as technical applications undreamed of in the pure theory on which they are based), and introduces new problems through the relationships between the emergent entities themselves (the clash of theories), between these and the physical environment (mastery and ruin), between these and human actors (proud makers and the brave openers of a Pandora's box)."

107-8:  "Consequently contradictions exist independently of people noticing them or caring about them--indeed since there are an infinite number of situations upon which any theory may bear, it might well contain logical contradictions of which no one is aware."

109:  "Epistemologically it is assumed here that the question 'what counts as contradiction?' can be answered by reference to the same criteria everywhere, namely those of formal logic."

111:  "Undoubtedly there are methodological problems involved in the cross-cultural identification of Systemic properties like contradiction; the question is whether these are manageable or intractable."

128:  "to make sense of the concept is to make manifest nonsense of the society"

Chapter 6: Contradictions and Complementarities in the Cultural System
---

143:  "our prime interest in the Cultural System lies precisely in its two-fold relationship with human agency; that is with its effects upon us (those logical properties which affect people) and our effects on it (how people can form and transform its logical properties)."

143:  "when we examine Systemic influences upon us, human agency appears as a ghost in the machine; on the other hand, the investigation of our cultural products views ghostly agents as creating the machine."

144:  "Consequently, analytical dualism is, first, based on the premisses that the CS originates from the S-C level (culture is man-made), but, second, that over time a stream of intelligibilia escape their progenitors and acquire autonomy as denizens of World Three, after which time we can examine how they act back on subsequent generations of people. Third, that since people go on making culture we can investigate how new items enter the CS and old ones are displaced, providing again that the timing is specified. Of course both CS and S-C effects are at work simultaneously throughout history, but it is impossible to unpack their morphogenetic or morphostatic contributions without making use of analytical dualism to disengage temporal cycles of Cultural Conditioning -> Cultural interaction -> Cultural Elaboration."

148:  Formal features of constraining contradiction: [opposite of concomitant complementarity]  "the contradiction is a property of the CS (A and B are logically inconsistent): it exerts a constraint upon the S-C level if any actor(s) wish to maintain A (whether a theory of belief)."

148:  "Assuming then that protagonists of A exist, the key point there is that their action in invoking A also ineluctably evokes B and with it the logical contradiction between them"

149:  "those adhering to A are in a situation where *the survival of A depends upon their repairing the inconsistency with B*. Since the relationship between A and B is a genuine logical contradiction then its *direct* resolution is logically impossible. Corrective manoeuvres are mandatory, but they require substantial theoretical work, even in the scientific domain where it may be possible to reduce the original contradiction to an apparent contradiction."

153:  Formal features of concomitant complementarities: [opposite of constraining contradiction] "invoking A also ineluctably evokes B, but since the B upon which this A depends is consistent with it, then B buttresses adherence to A. Consequently A occupies a congenial environment of ideas, the exploration of which, far from being fraught with danger, yields a treasure trove of reinforcement, clarification, confirmation and vindication--because of the logical consistency of the items involved." For instance, classical economics and utilitarian moral philosophy.

154-5:  Operative effects of constraining contradictions: "What constraining contradiction does in practice is to confront those committed to A who also have no option but to live with B as well, with a particular *situational logic*. According to this logic, given their initial commitment to A, they are driven to engage with something both antithetical but also indispensable to it--which therefore they can neither embrace as it stands nor reject out of hand. They must struggle to extract what is necessary from B, warding off B's counter-attractions or counter-claims and avoiding the seductive labyrinth of doubt, to return to A bearing their offering."

155:  "This situational logic spells mental torment, social subterfuge or technical contortions: it produces at worst a divided self denied refuge in schizophrenia."

156:  "If A and B are logically consistent then no genuine resolution is possible between them (unless it can be shown tht this is an apparent contradiction), but if B remains unaltered it threatens the credibility or tenability of A. Consequently the situational logic dictates that continued adherence to A makes a *correction* of its relationship with B mandatory [...]. Corrective action involves addressing the contradiction and seeking to *repair* it by reinterpration of the components involved."

157:  Operative effects of concomitant complementarities: "the situational logic generated by the concomitant compatibility is problem-free to the actors involved."

158:  "In brief the situational logic of concomitant compatibility conduces towards *protection* (the maintenance of purity), not *correction*."

159:  Divergent results of constraining contradictions: given the logical contradiction between A and B, the question is how the contradiction is going to be repaired, which involves the redefinition of either A or B. Three possibilities: "(1) A<-B, i.e. correcting B so it becomes consistent with A. (2) A<->B, i.e., correcting both A and B so they become mutually consistent. (3) A->B, i.e., correcting A so it becomes consistent with B."

Assuming perspective of A, these strategies are in declining preference: make B fit A, make B and A fit with one another, make A fit B. 

159:  A<-B: onus on A to actively eliminate contradiction through a reinterpretation of B thereby producing B^1, which is compatible with A. This means that B is replaced with B^1 and, further, that at the socio-cultural level that people accept the substitution of B^1 for B.

165:  A<->B: both A and B are transformed so as to allow A^1...A^n to be consistent with B^1...B^n such that there is no more contradiction between A^x and B^x.

168:  "Syncretism is morphogenetic because through it a new item enters the intelligibilia--a new theory or a new doctrine--but it is not always possible."

168:  A->B: identical but opposite of A<-B because it is A that undergoes transformation while B remains unchanged. This is necessary in one of two situations. First, every version of A advanced (...A^n) has been countered with a still contradictory B (...B^n). This forces substantial modifications of A if the adherents will not let go of it. Second, when A^n<->B^n cannot be made to work or generation traction.

168:  "In short this corrective adjustment of A to some version of B spells a radical change in its character: a shift to an A^n which often indicates the social demise of the theory or belief in relation to the salience originally achived for A and a degenerating problem-shift within the theory or belief itself."

169:  "Survival is always possible, the question is, on what terms?"

171:  "The basic proposition advanced is that the situational logic generated by the concomitant compatibility, which is concerned with the *protection* of consistency, generically results in ideational *systemization* [...]." 

Chapter 7: Socio-Cultural Interaction
---

185:  "orderly or conflictual relations at the S-C level can show a significant degree of *independent variation* from those characterizing the CS at any given time. In short, S-C integration does not mirror CS integration."

186:  "if culture behaves at all like structure then these deviations are crucial in accounting for future stability or change."

188:  "*It appears to me that the key to explaining independent Socio-Cultural variations lies in how the social (or sectional) distribution of interests and powers actually gel with the situational logic of the Cultural System (or subsystem) at any given time*."

189:  "cases where Socio-Cultural life appears to be unruffled by the Systemic perturbations." This does not necessarily mean that people hold contradictory beliefs without being affected by them; it is also possibly the case that people are unaware of the contradictions.

189:  "the fact of Socio-Cultural orderliness neither implies tolerance of contradiction nor acquaintance with its constituents."

189-90:  "*The use of power to control the social visibility of contradiction and the presence of interests which mitigate its impact, together account for manifestations of greater orderliness at the S-C compared with the CS level*."

190:  Advovcates of A, who are in a CS contradiction, prevent the contradiction from becoming a S-C controversy. Thus, strategic aim is to conceal the contradiction. "strategic maintenance of ignorance amongst vast tracts of the relevant population is regarded as a better of securing S-C orderliness than intensive indoctrination."

190:  "containment strategies are largely accountable for a lack of cultural change despite the existence of a fault-line running through the System."

190:  authoritarian containment: "*strategic limitation of what part of B is available to A*"

192:  sectional containment: "using non-decision-making to repel dangerous ideational contacts." Inverse of authoritarian containment in that it limits those who hold A from having access to B.

195:  "Important as cultural power turns out to be in the engineering of S-C orderlieness, it would still be a serious mistake to attribute every manifestation of the latter to an application of the former."

196:  "Groups which self-consciously adjure involvement and pursue their own self-sufficient interests effectively resist cultural manipulation, without correspondingly raising the level of cultural antagonism."

197:  "Where divisions of interests are pronounced, there is a predispostion towards disorderliness--to naked group antagonism at the S-C level--which is prior to anything that the proponents of correction may try to do."

198:  Desertion: "The first major manifestation of the failure of unificataion takes the form of an individual response--personal disenchantment with A and consequent disaffiliation."

199:  "disaffiliation can be of such magnitude that the numbers streaming through the exit progressively denude a cause of supporters."

199:  "Exit is then more than numerical depletion: it is the aggregative transfer of adept deductive reasoning power to external alternatives."

200:  Schmismatism and sectarianism: "those who were once united in their difficulties often fall into schismatism when they try to solve them."

201:  Counter-actualization: "Desertion and schismatism together constitute a positive feed-back loop. They culminate in a high level of CS disorder, as internecine divisions intensify, and this is outstripped by the S-C disorderliness associated with it. The deserter does not quietly go away. Some of those who had been passively manipulated by a unitary power now actively withhold authority from all parties seeking syncretic unification. It is in this context that those with an interest in so doing can harness S-C disorder to bring about the full actualization of B."

203:  Competitive contradiction: "When Pluralism wins out through counter-actualization, and the protagonists of A face the advocates of B, though their Scio-Cultural antagonism is mutual, they do not share the same situational logic stemming from the CS level. The essential differenc is that those retaining adherence to A are still in the business of correction because nothing had altered their tension with but dependence on B: the game has become harder, winning it more unlikely, but its name remains unchanged--syncretism. In some cases no more than the defensive syncretism of survival--the accommodation of A to B in order to stay alive. In complete contrast, the group now advocating B is utterly unrestrained by interdependence: the cultural stance adopted is independent of any revised version of A whatsoever. Far from pursuing union or attempting to sink their differences, the new proponents of B are in *competition* with adherents of A--a pure unbrindled competitiveness at the Systemic level which parallels their total Socio-Cultural hostility."

207:  "Confronted with a contradiction which has achieved some degree of social prominence, the basic reaction of those adhering to A is indeed to seek the elimination of opposition."

207-8:  "given that social imbalances are the rule rather than the exception, a refined version of the above, that is, dismissal-by-devaluation, is a frequent tactic used by the socially dominant in any field. [...] From our point of view the real problem with this tactic is not that it is ineffectual but rather that it is maximally effective against the weakest social groups--that is, just those whose position prevented them from attaining high Socio-Cultural salience for their ideas in the first place."

210:  "the sequence leading to cultural change is the opposite in the two cases: with contradictions, the fault-line is present from the start in the CS and has to be split open by S-C struggle, but with complementarities, S-C disorder has to develop until can damage the smooth face of the CS. The real problem here is *how* can Socio-Cultural relations actually become so disorderly?"

211:  "the concomitant complementarity *itself* generates a sufficient differentiation of interests to unleash S-C disorder eventually. Once again the dynamics of cultural morphogenesis can be *derived* from within the concomitant complementarity"

211:  Density and differetiation: "The root-cause in this case is the increase in CS *density* which, as has been seen, intensifies greatly as the complementarity is explored and systematized. Density in turn, is incompatible with complete sharing and the development of hierarchy is its inescapable S-C accompaniment. Hierarchy constitutes differentiated interests which are hostile to S-C order. In other words, it is argued that density and differentiation create a positive reinforcement loop which introduces disorderliness--whether or not there were any independent interests submerged from 'the start' by the use of cultural power."

212:  "CS density becomes the enemy of S-C equality."

213-4:  "The differentiation of interests and rewards creates the conditions for the use of cultural power by elites to maintain S-C order amongst the masses and the marginals."

217:  "Cultural morphogenesis *derives* from the concomitant complementarity only when marginal groups become migrants."

219:  "That for which the marginal migrants are alone responsible however, is *bringing the two items into active conjunction*."

219-20:  "Fundamentally a contingent complementarity is detected (on the derived scenario) because somebody has gone out of their way to look for one and with some idea of what they were looking for. Quite literally they were searching for a 'foreign' complement to a 'domestic' item."

Chapter 8: Elaboration of the Cultural System
---

229:  Substantive differences of competitive contradictions: in comparison to the constraining contradiction, "the competitive contradiction is not a matter of Systemic *constraint* for the new item is not dependent on the old. Here, to advocate this A is no sense invokes some B. [...] Insteaad this kind of contradiction is only activated if someone else insists on counterposing B and goes on doing so--thus enforcing debate between the two groups. In short, competitive contradictions, though systemic in substance, require Socio-Cultural activation. However, active opposition is a matter of Socio-Cultural contingency and not of Systemic inescapability."

229:  "The existence of opposing groups is an essential precondition of a competitive contradiction."

230:  "the *accentuation* of an 'independent' contradiction is a supremely social matter. Accentuation depends on groups, actuated by interests, *making* a contradiction competitive, by taking sides over it and by trying to make other people take their side. In short, these oppositional interest groups *cause* the contradiction to impinge on broader sections of the (relevant) population: it does not impose itself as the ineluctable force of ideas as is the case with constraining contradictions, the moment anyone asserts A."

231:  "The activation of competitive contradictions is then the direct responsibility of human agency, though this does not render the incompatibility itself one whit less Systemic. In other words, we are discussing the relationship between the S-C level and CS properties (causal effects upon the logical domain), as distinct from all the things over which social groups can disagree, conflict or struggle, many of which contain no logical contradiction whatsoever."

235:  "Ideologies are, then, genuine cases of competitive contradictions and in consequence have logical properties at the CS level which usually are either misrepresented (downwards conflationists) or neglected (upwards conflationists)."

235:  Substantive differences of contingent complementarities: "The basic difference between the contingent and the concomitant complementarity is that here A and B are indeed consistent but they are also independent. There is no sense in which the invocation of A also entails the concomitant evocation of B."

236:  "Like their counterparts, competitive contradictions, the *accentuation* of these complementarities is entirely dependent on action at the Socio-Cultural level. Usually, since A and B are unconnected, they will have independent origins being developed separately by different groups pursuing their particularistic interests--possibly generations or oceans apart. But the originators are not necessarily the key actors."

237:  "the complementarity of the items is a CS matter but the contingency of their conjunction is an S-C affair."

237:  "The two interactional factors crucial for determining which of these items became joined up and then underwent elaboration are, first, social or sectional salience for the two items sustained by different social groups and, second, certain opportunists, possibly from a third group, who perceive some advantage to be derived from exploration of the complementarity. Of the two conditions, it is the second which is decisive, for even if some contact mechanism performs the introduction between A and B, unless the connection is exploited by someone, the two items slip back into the systemic repository to become indistinguishable from the pool of other undetected but potential complementarities."

239:  Operative effects of competitive contradictions: "the situational logic created by the competitive contradiction is one which confronts people with *choice*. To be more precise, it is a logic which forces them to make choices, by accentuating differences, by insisting on their salience, by undermining indifference and by making the *question* of alignment inescapable."

240:  "the logical source of their opposition further conditions their course of action. In contradistinction to the constraining contradiction, here the situational logic dictates *elimination* not *correction*."

242:  Operative effects of contingent complementarities: "For the existence of these (socially known) compatibilities represents a source of novelty which the Cultural System extends to human agency with few strings attached. These condition action precisely because they *objectively increase the opportunity for cultural free play*--for novel combinations and applications involving conceptual integration, theoretical reduction or doctrinal extension, all of which have ideational synthesis as their common denominator."

243:  "Only the contingent complementarity simultaneously holds out choices to the adherents of A but leaves them free to make what they will (if anything) of B. It is not merely that the objective availability of different courses of action is greater; so is the freedom to determine what to do with these opportunities."

243:  "there are no containment strategies or exposure policies associated with the contingent compatibility. [...] Only the contingent compatibility is free from Socio-Cultural manipulation, designed to induce avoidance or adoption or aversion."

244:  "the situational logic of the contingent complementarity provides no directional guidance about what is to be done with B"

245:  Divergent results of competitive contradictions: "Pluralism is the generic consequence of competitive contradictions"

245-6:  Because elimination of the opponent is the goal, the result of the competitive contradiction is debate as opposed to dialogue. Hence, emphasis on identification of antitheses, mutual clarification of views.

246:  "Hence the primary feature of ideational competition is the differentiation of viewpoints from one another (through barbed interchange), and it stands in stark contrast to the efforts at effecting union between them (through mutual exchange), which are promoted by corrective contradictions."

246:  "Competition is quintessentially a morphogenetic process, that is it amplifies deviations from the original starting point, namely the positions from which the rivals first crossed swords."

256:  "The basic thrust is thus the precise antithesis of ideational unification promoted by the constraining contradiction: it is the accentuation of ideational differences in the population. Since it is *differences alone* which are increasingly distributed throughout the population (actors are presented with choice and pressured to align themselves), then the Systemic impetus is towards *social cleavage*. This is reinforced by the fact that the rivals themselves manifest their mutual hatred of compromise formulae and direct their conjoint forces to undermining any credibility or legitimacy of 'centrist' views. In brief, the debate between them fosters *polarization* among the relevant population."

258:  Divergent results of contingent complementarities: "the central argument that synthesis is the generic consequence of contingent complementarities refers strictly to the work performed on two consistent elements (to what our opportunists do when they take up a compatible item) and the results of these endeavours which they can then offer back to the Cultural System. How these are 'received', that is whether synthesis can itself be synthesized, is simultaneously a more macroscopic and a more substantive question."

259:  "Synthesis itself takes the form of a combination of ideas transferred from one or more domains to another. In certain instances the transfer is more pronounced, in others the fusion is most prominent, but it would always be a mistake to neglect either element in the synthetic process."

267:  "Variety feeds on what looks promising but is ill-defined; density deals with what feel like certainties yet are already over-defined. Variety pushes on to extend horizons haphazardly and unpredictably; density stays at home to embellish the local environments systematically."

Chapter 9: Towards a Theoretical Unification: structure, culture and morphogenesis
---

277:  "we can never arrive at knowledge of a Cultural System through personal introspection or participant observation. A lifetime of fieldwork could only yield up partial knowledge--at best an inventory of those components and their relations which are within the cognizance of the collectivity. A simple way of putting this is that Cultural Systems really pertain to libraries rather than to people."

282:  "the relative autonomy of culture will be upheld, as will that of structure"

282:  "their conceptual unification then paves the way for uniting structural and cultural analysis."

282:  "When both structure and culture are conceptualized from the morphogenetic perspective then *the two intersect in the middle element of the basic cycle*. In other words, the interactional phase, whether we are dealing with S-C interaction or that taking place between structured material interest groups, always entails a great deal of interpenetration between the two--this entailment being a matter of *sociological* necessity*."

283:  "most of the time it is empirically the case that we have to recognize that there is structural penetration of the cultural realm, and thus need to theorize about the intersection of the structural and cultural fields, for the simple sociological reason that actors themselves do have positions in both domains simultaneously."

284:  "The answers to these 'how' questions home in on the mechanisms through which (1) culture influences structure and (2) structure exerts its influence upon culture."

284:  "The basic mechanism by which cultural factors find their way into the structural field through the intersection is extremely simple. Let any material interest group (call some groups 'dominant' by all means if their societal or sectional dominance can be demonstrated empirically) endorse any doctrine (theory, belief or ideology) for the advancement of those interests (that is their articulation, assertion, or legitimation), and that group is immediately plunged into its situational logic."

286:  "Structural factors find their way into the cultural field by following the same path through the intersection, only here we have to look at what happens at the other end of it. Thus, let the advocacy of any doctrine (theory, belief or ideology) become associated with a particular material interest group and its fate becomes embroiled in the fortunes of that group *vis-a-vis* others. For all such attachments immediately enmesh cultural discourse in power play."
