Note: first volume in a "trilogy" of works elucidating a general critical realist social theory. *Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach* (CUP,1995) is the second volume and *Being Human: The Problem of Agency* (CUP, 2000) is the third volume. Since then has reconceived her project as providing the ontology for relational sociology's analytical framework. The trilogy does valuable work in clearing away "methodological individualism" and "methodological collectivism" through a new articulation of the relation between structure/agency called "the morphogenetic approach," but the account of the social is rather thing: only humans. 

Note: the is a second trilogy that elaborates on these themes in the context of reflexivity as constitutive of the late modern experience: *Structure, Agency, and the Internal Conversation* (CUP, 2003), *Making Our Way Through the World: Human Reflexivity and Social Mobility* (CUP, 2007), and *The Reflexive Imperative in Late Modernity* (CUP, 2012).

Preface
---

xi:  structure/agency is "rightly" the basic issue of modern social theory, but this has obscured the problem of culture/agency. Fortunately, both problems "raise identical difficulties and the method by which can they be resolved turns out to be exactly the same."

xi:  structure and culture are (1) substantially different domains; (2) relatively autonomous from one another.

xi:  Two considerations: (1) concepts used "have to respect and capture the substantive differences" because failing to do so would "[elide] the material and ideational aspect of social life" and (2) theory of structure=>social agent and culture=>cultural actor because we "be violating our ability to understand social life as the interplay between interests and ideas."

xii:  "the urgency of the problem of structure and agency is not one which imposes itself on academics alone, but on every human being."

xii:  "confronting the most pressing social problem of the human condition."

xiv-xxix:  proposes five theses on culture/agency: (1) on conflation [xiv-xvi], (2) on analytical dualism [xvi-xix], (3) on the interface [xix-xxiv], (4) on morphogenesis and morphostasis [xxiv-xxvii], and (5) on unification [xxvii-xxix].

xiv:  conflation: point is to "link" structure/culture to agency rather than "sink" them into one another because despite the proximity of phenomena, they are analytically distinct. "the 'parts' and the 'people' are *not* co-existent through time and therefore any approach which amalgamates them wrongly foregoes the possibility of examining the interplay between them over time."

xvi:  analytical dualism: "there is no suggestion that we are dealing with separate entities, only analytically separable ones and ones which it is theoretically useful to treat separately." Develops analytical dualism in culture through analogy with Lockwood. 

David Lockwood, "Social Integration and System Integration," in *Explorations in Social Change*, edited by G.K. Zollschan and W. Hirshch, #-##?. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1964.

xvii:  refers to Durkheim's lectures on evolution of educational thought for giving material to come up with a cultural counterpart to Lockwood--"cultural contradictions" and "cultural complementaries."

xviii:  Cultural System [CS] integration, "the degree of logical consistency," "relations between the components of culture"; Socio-Cultural integration [S-C], "the extent of causal cohesion," "relationships between cultural agents." "The CS/S-C distinction therefore maps onto that between culture without a knowing subject and culture with a knowing subject."

xviii:  "culture as a whole is taken to refer to all intelligibilia, that is to any item which has the dispositional capacity of being understood by someone. Within this I then distinguish the Cultural System, which is that sub-set of items to which the law of contradiction can be applied. There are propositions, for only statements which assert truth or falsity can be deemed to be in contradictio or to be consistent with one another. In turn this means that the Cultural System is restricted to the propositional register of society at any given time. The justification for defining the CS in this way rest partly on the fact that it meets the criterion of methodological workability, but partly, too, on the self-evident importance of those things held to be true or false in society at any given time or place."

xviii-xix:  "we generate myths, are moved by mysteries, become rich in symbolics and ruthless in manipulating hidden persuaders. But all of these elements are precisely the stuff of Socio-Cultural interaction. For they are all matters of interpersonal influence, whether we are talking at one extreme of hermeneutic understanding (including religious experience at the furthest extremity) or of the manipulative assault and battery of ideas used ideologically. All those other non-propositional things to which we assent or over which we dissent--such as tastes and preferences, likes and dislikes, affinities and animosities, patriotism and prejudice--lie in between. And all of this takes place outside of, *en dépit de*, the cannons of logic, whether knowingly on the part of actors (proclaiming the mystery of faith), or whether imposed on unknowing others (recipients of symbolic machinations), or whether as that semi-knowledgeable mish-mash called 'public opinion.'"

xix:  "Clearly the Cultural System and Socio-Cultural life do not exist or operate independently of one another; they overlap, intertwine and are mutually influential." Hence, the point is not that they are distinct (i.e., dualism), but that *analytical* dualism is the only way the interplay between the two can be adequately explored/explained.

xx:  interface: "how do we conceptualize their [CS/S-C] interplay; and, through this, how do we gain theoretical leverage upon cultural dynamics?" "My objective is to theorize about the *conditions* for cultural stability or change, and my basic hypothesis is that these conditions are rooted in the *conjunction* between the Cultural System and the Socio-Cultural interaction--just as they are grounded in the conjuncture between social and system integration in the structural domain."

xxi:  "Generically it is how contradictory or complementary relations between 'parts' of the Cultural System map onto orderly or conflictual relationships between 'people' at the Socio-Cultural level which determines whether the outcome is cultural stability or change. This means that we need to specify, first, which Systemic relations impinge upon agency and how they do so; and, second, which social relations affect how agents respond to and react back on the Cultural System."

xxi:  "analysis does *not* begin with a complete description of the Cultural System: a full itemization of its contradictions and complementarities being both impossible and irrelevant. Instead we start with *the ideas which at any given time have holders*, and restrict ourselves to these items. For only if an item is held by someone can its logical relationships with other items have any effect on agency."

xxii:  "contradictions mould problem-ridden situations for actors which they must confront *if and when* they realize, or are made to acknowledge, that they proposition(s) they endorse is enmeshed in some inconsistency. What they do next is not determined: they have the options of irrational dogmatism or of abandoning the theory or belief altogether, *but* if they want to go on holding it non-dogmatically then their only recourse is to repair the inconsistency, that is the force of the situational logic. By contrast, complementarities mould problem-free situations for agents who can explore their ideational environments without danger or difficulty and from this build up an elaborate conspectus, the elements of which are mutually consistent and reinforcing. This by contrast fosters a situational logic of reproduction aimed at retaining this felicitous cluster and discouraging alterations in it."

xxii:  "these Systemic influences are only part of the story about how cultural situations are moulded for actors. The other part is made up of the causal relations operating between groups and individuals at the Socio-Cultural level. Such relationships have their own dynamics, rooted in different material interests, producing various forms of social stratification and different ideal interests, such as ethnic, religious or linguistic divides (which are ideational but not propositional). These make their own contribution to cultural stability or change through the influences they exert upon what actors do on the spot. They form the other side of the interface and are thus co-determinants (with Systemic conditioning) of what actually takes place there. Systemic conditioning only appears (and this is nothing more than appearance) to be decisive when Socio-Cultural influences happen to be pulling in the same direction. It is, therefore, easier to pin-point their independent contribution when social orderliness or disorderliness are pulling in different directions, that is operating at variance with Systemic conditioning. Under such conditions one readily identify the main ways in which they work at the interface."

xxiii:  "It is universally the case that Socio-Cultural imbalances, and the power differentials deriving from them, affect the degree of awareness or 'discursive penetration' that actors have of ideational contradictions or complementaries themselves. Thus, for example, when some dominant material-interest group supports a set of propositions which are embroiled in contradiction, they will use their power to control the visibility of inconsistent items through a variety of 'containment strategies', the most blatant of which is censorship. If successful, the subordinate agents will remain unruffled by the inconsistencies attending the group's beliefs for they are in the dark about them; the Systemic fault-line represented by the contradiction will remain unexploited, even by those who have the interests to split it wide open, because power has kept it unperceived. Consequently, in this instance, social imbalance produces orderly Socio-Cultural relations, maintaining the cultural status quo whilever agents' access to information can be controlled."

xiii:  "the nature of Socio-Cultural relations affects which of the responses forged under the pressure of the situational logic can actually be made to stick. Again, fundamentally and universally no corrective formula (generated to repair contradictions) and no reproductive scheme (elaborated to protect complementarities) can be made to 'take' in society when the contemporaneous distribution of interests and power do not gel with it. Instead a variety of ideational shifts will be registered depending on the nature of the disjuncture to counter-actualization and including schismatism and Specialization."

xxiv:  morphogenesis/morphostability: "the unique feature distinguishing social Systems from organic or mechanical ones is their capacity to undergo radical restructuring." Morphogenesis refers to "the complex interchanges that produce change in a System's given form, structure or state [...] the end product being termed 'Elaboration'." Morphostasis is the opposite process. "the morphogenetic perspective is not only dualistic but sequential, dealing in endless three-part cycles of Structural Conditioning -> Social interaction -> Structural Elaboration. The suggestion is that this framework be transferred to the cultural field, using equivalent analytic phases (i.e., Cultural Conditioning -> Socio-Cultural interaction -> Cultural Elaboration), in order to unravel the dialectical interplay of culture and agency over time."

xxiv:  this requires that time be central to social theory. "Time is incorporated as a theoretical variable rather than simply as a medium in which events take place."

xxv:  "culture and agency operate over different time periods." 

xxv:  "the Cultural System logically predates the Socio-Cultural action(s) which transform it; and that Cultural Elaboration logically post-dates such interaction."

xxvii:  unification: "the possible conceptual and theoretical unification of structural and cultural analysis from the morphogenetic perspective."

xviii:  "But utilizing this common framework it becomes easier to see *how* structure and culture intersect in the middle element of their respective morphogenetic cycles: through structural-interest groups endorsing some corpus of ideas in order to advance their material concerns but then becoming enmeshed in the situational logic of that part of the cultural domain; and through ideal-interest groups seeking powerful sponsors to promote their ideas but then immediately embroiling cultural discourse in power-lay within the structural domain."

Chapter 1: The Myth of Cultural Integration
---

1:  Culture has "the weakest analytical development of any key concept in sociology [...]"

1:  Descriptive level: "remains inordinately vague despite little dispute that it is indeed a core concept," "there are as yet no 'units' for describing culture," "instead of different 'cultural structures' there are endless 'cultural differences'."

1:  Explanatory level: "culture swings from being the prime mover (credited with engulfing and orchestrating the entire social structure) to the opposite extreme where it is reduced to a mere epiphenomenon (charged only with providing an ideational representation of culture)."

Are these two claims (descriptive, explanatory) still true in light of the development of Jeff Alexander's strong program in cultural sociology?

3:  a priori assumption regarding culture derives from anthropological theory: "On the one hand, its strong aesthetic rather than analytical orientation, which led to an endorsement of '"artistic" hermeneutics as the method for grasping the inner sense of cultural wholes'. On the other hand this approach, based on the intuitive understanding of cultural configurations, entailed a crucial prejudgement, namely an insistence that coherence was there to be found, that is a mental closure against the discovery of cultural inconsistencies."

4:  the standard appropriation of culture in sociological theory confounds two issues. First, logical consistency, "the degree of internal compatibility between the components of culture" and, second, casual consensus, "the degree of social uniformity produced by the imposition of culture [...] by one set of people on another."

4:  "The main proposition advanced here is that the two are logically and empirically distinct, hence they can vary independently of one another."

5:  "Power relations are the causal element in cultural consensus building and, far from unproblematically guaranteeing behavioural conformity, they can provoke anything from ritualistic acceptance to outright rejection of the culture imposed."

6:  "the basic deficiency of the anthropological heritage, as appropriated in sociology, was that it resisted making any analytical distinctions at all. The net effect of this insistence on cultural compactness was that it precluded any theory of cultural development springing from internal dynamics."

7:  "The image of cultural coherence is grounded in traditional society."

14:  "the theoretical incorporation of inconsistency at the Systemic level does two things: it specifies certain necessary conditions for stability or change in the Cultural System. Every contradiction represents a potential for change. Whether it does lead to this rather than to active containment depends on the activities of groups and individuals at the Socio-Cultural level. Thus the second implication of giving due attention to the flaws in Cultural System integration is the necessity of distinguishing this level analytically from Socio-Cultural integration--for the latter determines the fate of those discontinuities, that is whether they are amplified into recognisable changes or damped down to preserve the picture of social continuity."

15:  "cultural coherence may not stem from the integration of the Cultural System but from the lack of alternatives to it--and this itself is a property of the System. Too frequently it has been presumed to be a property of the Socio-Cultural level."

15-6:  "Equally this question of alternatives (like our discussions of inconsistencies) is linked to the conditions of cultural stability or change. The existence of alternatives at the Systemic level, or the presence of *variety* as it is termed in information theory, is essential for *adaptive Systems*. This mathematical theory postulates some source which continuously generates variety (new signals, symbols, messages) and some receiver who can put this variety to use." This view from information theory is helpful in two regards: first, "alternatives (variety) must be available to be drawn upon the Systemic level" and, second, "that there must be receivers at the Socio-Cultural level who are willing and able to make use of them."

18:  "cultural poverty is like physical poverty--grinding."

18:  "Primitive cultural accumulation is almost as difficult as primitive capital accumulation and is, of course, related to it."

20-1:  "In the first case (typical of normative functionalism) the Myth was restated in terms of 'downwards' conflation. Here, Cultural System integration engulfs Socio-Cultural integration through processes of orchestration, regulation and internalization. In the opposite case (represented by neo-Marxism) the Myth was re-instated in the form of 'upwards' conflation. Basically the Socio-Cultural level swallows up the Cultural System as the effect of social domination and ideological manipulation. Finally, just as both of these versions were becoming rather frayed under the wear and tear of criticism, the Myth was suddenly revitalized by a brand new exposition of it--this time taking the form of 'central' conflation (typified by the 'structuration' approach). This was not merely another shot in the arm: rather it extended an eternal life-support system to the Myth by seeking to banish for good the analytical dualism, one which the present critique depends. To these theorists the Myth did indeed elide the Systemic and Socio-Cultural levels--but rightly so. Since the two were mutually constitutive and consequently inseparable, it was therefore improper to analyse them dualistically. That this full-frontal defence of the inexorable duality of culture was even less capable of providing a theory of cultural change than the two preceding forms of conflation, is taken here to constitute the final condemnation of the whole conflationary procedure."

21:  "The common denominator of the various conflationists who buttress the Myth of Cultural integration is that they elide logical relations with causal connections and then judge this *ensemble* to make a coherent whole. On the contrary, an approach based on analytical dualism challenges this judgement and the premisses on which it is founded. Instead, by distinguishing logical relations (pertaining to the Cultural System) form the causal relations (pertaining to the SOcio-Cultural level) and allowing of their independent variation, the interface between them becomes a problematic area for intensive exploration. The results of this would identify the *conditions* for integration in the cultural realm, without that state of affairs being taken as a foregone conclusion--any more than it can be in the structural domain. Cultural integration is demythologized by rendering it contingent upon the particular patterning of inter-connections *at* the two different levels and *between* the two different levels."

Chapter 2: 'Downwards Conflation': on keys, codes and cohesion
---

Discussing Functionalism and Structuralism as modes of downwards conflation

28-9:  "As far as the analysis of the Cultural System is concerned the 'essence of the logico-meaningful method of cognition is ... in the finding of the central principle (the 'reason') which permeates all the components, gives sense and significance to each of them, and in this way makes cosmos of a chaos of unintegrated fragments'. But how do we avoid imposing a meaning which is simply not there, or how do we validate the meanings we claim to detect? Sorokin's answer is that we avoid false attribution by identifying the 'major premise of each system', and are subsequently confirmed in the correctness of our identification by the fact that this 'major premise' will then act as 'the key', in conjunction with the canons of logic, to 'the nature of the entire unity'. The presumption that there is a key to be found, which is itself predicated on the assumption that Cultural Systems are coherently ordered, though not obviously so at first glance, is Sorokin's lasting bequest to sociology."

Discussing Peter Sorokin, *Social and Cultural Dynamics*. London: Peter Owen, 1957.

29:  However, Sorokin is unable to specify how this key (or code) is identified and how what is identified is known to be correct; e.g., does not seem to recognize possibility of selective or false identification. Likewise, he claims there are two ideal types of Cultural Systems (Ideational, Sensate), but recognizes that the idea types rarely exist in pure form, thus leading to the conclusion that the vast majority of Cultural Systems are composed of various mixes of the two. But, there is no reason to assume that the mix is in any way coherent. Sorokin notes, "Thus the logic of such a cultural type is often nonlogical or illogical."

31:  "Because of the empirical predominance of 'mixture' at the Systemic level, Sorokin is driven to talk not about influence of *the* Cultural System but about the effect of the *dominant* culture. [...] what makes the dominant dominate remains an enigma, since Sorokin never grounds domination in social interaction."

33:  "mainstream [Parsonian] Functionalism pressed on with downwards conflation in a more sophisticated but also more rigid form."

33:  Blake & Davis: fallacy of normative determinism--"the error of assuming that because norms (at the Cultural System level) are meant to control behaviour, then this is sufficient ground for assuming that they successfully do so (at the Socio-Cultural level)."

35:  "Like Sorokin he [Parsons] can offer no mechanism for *accounting* for the predominance of certain values."

38-9:  "the superficial appearance which culture presented to its observers was closer to the old imagery of 'booming, buzzing confusion', but its hidden interconnections could be explicated by detection of an underlying and covert *code* which regulated them. The basic idea, stemming from linguistic structuralism, was that cultures could be decoded. The fundamental premiss here is obviously that Cultural Systems are in fact encoded (ontologically they are codes): the fundamental methodological implication for sociology is clearly that its task is to decipher them."

39:  Structuralists had Durkheim, Mauss, Saussure in background, but drew especially on Chomsky; specifically, two principles: "that of a limited number of generative principles underlying any linguistic manifestation, and the associated idea of 'rule-governed creativity', that is the possible production of unlimited manifestations which were none the less obedient to the code. Already in Chomsky's above notions, the germs of conflation abound. The generative principles (the linguistic code) regulate linguistic creativity (social usage of language). In other words, the independence of the latter (the Socio-Cultural level in our terms) is reduced to its ingenuity in elaborating permutations of the code (the Systemic level in our terms). As the users make and can make no reciprocal contribution to altering the code itself, the downwards inflection is also implicit."

39:  "Essentially the very nature of the structuralist endeavour involves the assumption of *discoverable cultural coherence*."

40:  "Not only is Cultural System integration deemed to be exceedingly high from the structuralist perspective but, in typical conflationist fashion, it is held to generate an equivalent degree of Socio-Cultural integration."

40:  "When carried over [linguistic model of reproducing the language in each grammatical utterance] to the cultural realm it means that to employ any cultural element (cooking a meal, singing a song, gaining a living, explaining the cosmos) invokes the Systemic code and therefore enmeshes those engaging in such activities in its Socio-Cultural reproduction."

43:  "By presuming that Cultural Systems are indeed coded phenomena, they are necessarily assumed to be susceptible of decoding. Hence decipher*ing* becomes a technical problem; decipher*ability* is not questioned, even when it is beyond our present ingenuity."
