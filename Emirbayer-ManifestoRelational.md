282:  "The key question confronting sociologists in the present day is not 'material versus ideal,' 'structure versus agency,' 'individual versus society,' or any of the other dualisms so often noted; rather, it is the choice between substantialism and relationalism."

282-3:  Substantialism assumes that there are pre-formed, self-subsistent social entities which then interact with one another.

283:  Drawing upon Dewey & Bentley (1949), identifies two forms of substantialism: self-action and inter-action.

283-5:  Self-action refers to substances/entities where relations are "no more than empty media for their self-generation, self-moving activity." Four examples: Aristotle's physics (including Christian doctrine of the soul), the will in liberal political theory/methodological individualism in social sciences (e.g., rational choice and game theory), norm-following individuals (roughly, neo-Kantian alternative to account for n0n-rational action of individuals: critical theory, value analysis, microsociology), and holism/structuralisms (inverse of methodological individualism in that structures/societies rather than individuals are the source of self-action--neo-functionalism, systems theory). 

285-6:  Inter-action is "where entities no longer generate their own action, but rather, the relevant action takes place *among* the entities themselves." Most obvious example is classical mechanics; e.g., billiard balls. Here, "Entities remain fixed and unchanging throughout such interaction." Sociological examples are survey research, historical-comparative, and variable-centred (e.g., multiple regression, factor analysis, event history). 

286:  Dewey & Bentley identify "trans-action" as the opposite of substantialism, which is roughly what Emirbayer means by relational.

287:  "the very terms or units involved in a transaction derive their meaning, significance, and identity from the (changing) functional roles they play within that transaction."

287:  Pre-given units/concepts, such as individual and society, cannot be the "ultimate starting points" of sociological analysis; e.g., Harrison White: "Persons should be a construct from the middle of the analysis, not a given boundary condition."

289:  "What is distinct about the transactional approach is that it sees relations between terms or units ars preeminently dynamic in nature, as unfolding, ongoing processes rather than as static ties among inert substances."
