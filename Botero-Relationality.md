Uses "whilst" far too much. Very distracting.

402:  "Relationality therefore encourages the examination of 'homologies' between sets of practices. In *Distinction*, it is the 'homology' between the space of lifestyles and the space of social positions which gives practices their meaning."

402:  "Whilst Bourdieu's approach to sociology is distinctive, his particular approach to relationality is no guarantee against charges of reificiation, or excessive objectivism or individualism."

402:  "Whilst Bourdieu's approach is *relational*, it does not focus on *social relationships*, understood as social networks or as an interactional order."

403:  "Social capital, and the network of social interaction that underpins it, receive much less attention in Bourdieu's framework."

405:  "There is little sense within Bourdieu's sociology of how the social ties of potential group members play a part in their mobilization. Yet, social movement theory suggests that concrete social connections must be explored to explain group formation (and dissolution)."

413:  "By limiting consideration of the concrete nature of social networks as a feature of social space, Bourdieu ignores the interactional properties of that space, and so underplays the intersubjective character of practice."

413:  "a greater emphasis both on the intersubjective negotiation and coordination of practices, and on the concrete interpersonal networks of interdependency, obligation and constraint through which intersubjective negotiation and accountability flow."

417:  "Intersubjective negotiation is a condition of all practice."
