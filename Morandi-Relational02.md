104:  "the hallmarks of the relation-root are (1) necessity: relation exists as a (predicative) property of the primary substance (the real human being); and (2) determinability (not determination!), which gives rise to contingency and pertains to the historical interaction with other actors."

106:  "Social relational ontology is above all based on the fact that social reality as actuality and potency is *always inter-related*, and for this reason social phenomena are finitely and not infinitely contingent (thus there is no need for a 'reducer' of complexity because reality itself is this reducer)."

107:  "*social phenomena* [â€¦] are *relational facts of reciprocity*"

110:  "the starting-point is the relational property that distinguishes the social from what is not social, i.e. the relation of reciprocity."

111:  Relations can be divided into two sorts: "naturally determined relations (the ontology of physical entities)" and "relations determined by intelligent agency (the ontology of intelligent and free entities)."
