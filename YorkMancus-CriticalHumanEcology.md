122:  Critical Human Ecology (CHE) combines "strengths" of biophysical human ecology with historical materialism. 

122:  CHE "could benefit the discipline of sociology, environmental sociology in particular, and the quest to understand human interactions with the natural environment."

123:  "Critical scholarship in environmental sociology has typically been more concerned with the social causes of environmental impacts and has given only secondary importance to the role of the environment in shaping societies and spurring social change."

124:  CHE has implications "including but not limited to the analysis of subsistence strategies, social relations of production, anthropogenic impacts on the environment, environmental constraints on social processes, the requirements for ecological and social sustainability, and socioecological crisis."

124:  "CHE can be broadly conceived of as a materialist approach to social science that seeks to understand divergence and convergence across and within societies as well as throughout human history, to identify and analyze the impacts that human beings have on the ecosystems that sustain, and to integrate environmental factors (e.g., climate, geography, and resource availability) into the analyses of human societies."

124:  "the materialist orientation of human ecology, which insists that changing material conditions of societies are the basis for their interaction with the environment, and that all societies are constrained and shaped by their concrete ecological contexts."

126:  "This [anthropocentric] bias, they [Catton & Dunlap, 1978] argued, tended to view culture---the human propensity for social learning and problem solving, the capacity for language, and the epigenetic transmission of knowledge---as a feature that established human beings as distinct and separate from all of the earth's other inhabitants."

126:  "This anthropocentric bias involved the expectation that human cultures can outpace or transcend altogether the ecological consequences of their activities."

131:  "While qualitative understanding of the ways in which facts exist in their social totality is of vital importance, quantitative analysis of that very patterning is also a useful tool in a critical human ecology, since one crucial question for any science is how to select appropriate material for the adjudication of claims, not simply the method chosen to do so."

131:  "Critical work, in this formulation, is not limited to textual and discursive analysis, but centers on the investigation of how human beings produce and reproduce their material lives and the constraints and possibilities these productive relations generate."

132:  "Central to a materialist ecology is the observation that all living organisms change the very conditions for living. Hence, the human propensity to do the same suggests social continuity with the natural world."

134:  Discussing Carolan (2005a, 2005b; critical realist): "Although the social is rooted in and emergent from the biological, the social also has causal efficacy upon the biological. Hence, trying to establish unidirectional causal relations between elements at one level and another level can miss the reciprocal influences between the two."

137:  Responding to (neo)-Malthusians: "From the CHE perspective, addressing population growth is a necessary, yet insufficient condition for achieving sustainability."

138:  "although modern capitalist societies have their own particular dynamics that have led to a global environmental crisis, they are not alone in generating environmental problems."

140:  "CHE agrees [â€¦] that societies are clearly affected by their environments, but it rejects the notion that most social features can be understood as adaptations to the environment. Cultural practices and institutions can just as well be maladaptive."

141:  "Furthermore, since humans are thinking agents, they are obviously capable of recognizing the challenges of survival posed by their environmental contexts and of adjusting their behavior accordingly."

141:  "What is needed is a perspective that recognizes that human societies are embedded in the natural environment, affect it, and are affected by it, but that does not take the crude functionalist view that social features are simply adaptations to the biophysical context. In providing such a perspective, CHE takes the structural view that internal and external aspects of societies shape and constrain their evolution, but that this dynamic does not *necessarily* lead to adaptation."

143:  "Many features of societies may, therefore, be better understood as spandrels rather than adaptations."
